Let's unpack Helena Liu’s video **“3 AI ‘Secrets’ 99% of People Don’t Know”** — each ‘secret’ is actually a practical methodology using widely accessible AI tools to boost personal learning, work productivity, and AI project performance. Below is a detailed breakdown of all three strategies, including the *core methodology*, *tools involved*, and *the prompts Helena used or implied*.## 1. **Your Personal AI Tutor**  
**Goal:** Automatically create custom lectures (video, slides, and voice-over) for any topic you want to learn.

### Tools Used
- **Perplexity AI** — for research and collecting top learning resources.  
- **Google NotebookLM** — for building structured lectures from training sources.

### Methodology
1. **Research content in Perplexity:** Ask it to find high-quality resources (tutorials, guides, docs) about a specific topic.
2. **Export the URLs** that Perplexity provides (20–50 resources recommended).
3. **Paste them into NotebookLM:** Create a new notebook and select “Train on websites.”
4. **Generate a custom lecture in Studio:** Click *Video Overview*, then add a **specific learning goal or style** if desired.
5. **Optional customization:** Adjust NotebookLM’s prompts to focus on subtopics or depth levels (e.g., beginner Python loops).

### Example Prompt (from video)
> “I like to learn Python. Please give me the top 20 to 50 resources that you can find online that teach this. Note: the site is not the product page. Give me the URLs only.”

Then in NotebookLM:
> “Create a video lecture to teach me Python fundamentals for beginners, with slides and voice narration.”

### Outcome
NotebookLM generates a **custom lecture video** that summarizes all linked materials. You can then refine it (“teach me Python loops next”), essentially turning AI into an adaptive teacher.## 2. **Impress Your Boss with AI Reports**  
**Goal:** Convert complex financial or analytical data into polished, interactive visual reports.

### Tools Used
- **Perplexity AI** — to analyze official data sources like SEC filings.  
- **Google Gemini Canvas (via gemini.google.com)** — to transform the text report into a website or infographic.

### Methodology
1. **Prompt Perplexity** to analyze a company’s financials, focusing on health, risks, growth, and metrics.  
2. Enable **Perplexity’s “Finance” mode** by clicking the globe icon → “Finance.”  
3. Copy Perplexity’s auto-generated detailed report.  
4. **Paste it into Gemini Canvas**; enable ‘Canvas’ tool under Tools.  
5. Select “Create → Website” or “Create → Infographic.”  
6. Refine visuals or add details before exporting and sharing.

### Example Prompt (from video)
> “Analyze these SEC filings of Starbucks (ticker symbol SBUX). Focus on financial health, growth and profitability, risks, competitive position, management discussion, evaluation metrics, red flags, and investment verdict.”

### Outcome
Within minutes, Gemini converts the findings into a **beautiful website or infographic**, ideal for reports or presentations.## 3. **The Real Way to Make ChatGPT an Expert**  
**Goal:** Go beyond “act as an expert” prompts — train ChatGPT (or other AI models) deeply on authoritative research data.

### Tools Used
- **ChatGPT (or similar LLM)** — for deep research phase and as the final “expert” interface.  
- **Google Docs** — for organizing research output.  
- **ChatGPT’s “Projects” feature** — to store and reuse custom-trained contexts.

### Methodology
1. **Ask ChatGPT to do deep research** — instead of skipping straight to “act as” prompts, have it collect and synthesize extensive reference material first.
2. **Save the research** — copy its long-form findings (she generated 18 pages in the demo) into a Google Doc, then export as PDF.
3. **Upload to ChatGPT’s Project folder:** give it a name (e.g., “Copywriting Expert”) and add the PDF file.
4. **Future chats within this Project** will use the uploaded dataset as embedded training content.

### Example Prompt (from video)
> “Do research on the most compelling copywriting techniques that get people to buy. Dive deep into the psychology.”

After research and upload:
> “Using the materials in this project, write ad headlines for a new fitness program designed for beginners.”

### Outcome
This workflow **teaches the model** effectively, giving it lasting context and expertise specific to your domain — far more consistent than “pretend you’re an expert” prompting.## Summary Table
| Technique | Core Tools | Primary Prompt | Output |
|------------|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Personal AI Tutor | Perplexity + NotebookLM | “I like to learn [topic]... give top 20–50 learning resources (URLs only).” | Custom video lecture with slides and narration |
| Impress Your Boss | Perplexity + Gemini Canvas | “Analyze SEC filings of [company] focusing on financial health, risks...” | Interactive report, website, or infographic |
| Make ChatGPT an Expert | ChatGPT Projects + Docs | “Do deep research on [topic], dive into the psychology.” | Knowledge-trained project folder; reusable expert model |

Each method turns existing AI tools into **coordinated workflows** — learners, analysts, and creators can all dramatically scale output and comprehension using these three “secrets.”
