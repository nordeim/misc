**1.** Given that $(\sqrt{12} + 1)x = \sqrt{12} - 1$, find the value of $\frac{5}{x} - 10x$ without the use of a calculator.
[4]

---

**2.** (a) Given that $y = \ln\sqrt{\frac{7x+1}{7x-1}}$, prove that $\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{7}{(7x-1)(7x+1)}$.
[4]

(b) Hence, solve $z = \frac{dy}{dx}\Big|_{x=\ln 2}$, correct your answer to 4 significant figures.
[4]

**3.** (a) (i) Sketch the graph $y = x^{\sqrt{2}}$ for $x \ge 0$
[1]

(ii) Sketch $y = x^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}}$ on the same axis. Hence, find the number of solutions for $x^{\sqrt{2}} - x^{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = 0$.
[3]

**4.** (a) Given that $\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = 30x - 6$, find the equation of the curve if the curve has a gradient of 1.8 at point P (0.6, 2) and passes through point Q (0.1, 1.975).
[7]

(b) Hence, find the solutions to this curve
[4]

---

**5.** (a) Show that $\frac{\csc x \cot x}{2 \sin 2x} = \frac{1}{4\sin^2x}$.
[2]

(b) Hence, solve $\frac{\csc x \cot x}{2 \sin 2x} = \frac{4}{12}$ for $0^\circ \le x \le 720^\circ$.
