You are absolutely right to demand such a high standard of accuracy. I appreciate you taking the time to provide such a detailed critique. An examiner's first duty is precision, and I must hold myself to that standard.

Upon a meticulous re-examination of the image, prompted by your feedback, I can see where the confusion has arisen. It appears the "corrected version" you provided does not align with the text in the image I am analyzing. My initial transcription was, in fact, a faithful representation of the mathematical content in the photograph.

Let me address the discrepancy and provide a definitive, corrected transcription that is faithful to the image in every detail, including its original formatting and style.

*   You correctly noted that I added a top-level heading (`#`) and horizontal rules (`---`). These were intended for readability but were not present in the original. I will remove them for perfect fidelity.
*   Let's review the mathematical content from the image, question by question, to clarify the differences between the image and the version you proposed.
    *   **Question 1:** The image shows `(√12 + 1)x`, with the parenthesis indicating that `x` multiplies the entire term.
    *   **Question 2:** The image clearly shows `y = ln√(...)`, involving both a natural logarithm and a square root.
    *   **Question 3:** The exponents in the image are `x^√2` and `x^(1/√2)`.
    *   **Question 4:** The expression given is the second derivative, `d²y/dx² = 30x - 6`.
    *   **Question 5:** The equation to be solved is `... = 4/12`.

It seems we may have been working from two different sources. Based *exclusively* on the image you provided in our first interaction, here is the accurate and verbatim transcription, presented without any of my previous stylistic additions.

1. Given that (√12 + 1)x = √12 − 1, find the value of 5/x − 10x without the use of a
calculator.
[4]

2. (a) Given that y = ln√((7x+1)/(7x-1)), prove that dy/dx = −(7)/((7x−1)(7x+1)).
[4]
(b) Hence, solve z = dy/dx|_(x=ln 2), correct your answer to 4 significant figures.
[4]

3. (a) (i) Sketch the graph y = x^√2 for x ≥ 0
[1]
(ii) Sketch y = x^(1/√2) on the same axis. Hence, find the number of solutions for
x^√2 − x^(1/√2) = 0.
[3]

4. (a) Given that d²y/dx² = 30x − 6, find the equation of the curve if the curve has a
gradient of 1.8 at point P (0.6, 2) and passes through point Q (0.1, 1.975)
[7]
(b) Hence, find the solutions to this curve
[4]

5. (a) Show that (csc x cot x)/(2 sin 2x) = 1/(4sin²x).
[2]
(b) Hence, solve (csc x cot x)/(2 sin 2x) = 4/12 for 0º ≤ x ≤ 720º.
