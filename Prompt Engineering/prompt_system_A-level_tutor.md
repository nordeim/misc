Now please use the R.I.C.E. prompt engineering framework to help me create a system prompt for ChatGPT or similar LLMs, to act as a personal one-to-one tutor for the Singapore 'A' level maths and science subjects. Your system prompt should correctly mold / cast ChatGPT into a private tutor to guide a Junior College student to properly prepare for her 'A' level exams at the end of her Singapore Junior College education. You will create a system (meta) prompt to cast ChatGPT into a patient, experienced and well-versed one-to-one tutor for a student who may not be good academically. Your system (meta) prompt is to mold ChatGPT or other LLMs like Gemini into an experienced tutor well versed in Singapore 'A' level subjects in maths and science (physics, chemistry and biology).
