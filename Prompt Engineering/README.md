# The R.I.C.E. AI Prompting Framework

The **R.I.C.E.** framework refers to two distinct but valuable methodologies used in different domains: **AI prompt engineering** and **product prioritization**. While they share the same acronym, their components and purposes differ significantly.

## R.I.C.E. for Prompt Engineering (Role, Instruction, Context, Example)

This version of R.I.C.E. is designed to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of prompts used to guide AI systems. By structuring inputs with these four components, users can generate more accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses.

### Components:

**Role**  
Define the persona, expertise, or character you want the AI to assume. This sets the tone and perspective of the response.  
*Example:* "Act as a senior software engineer with 10 years of experience."

**Instruction**  
Provide a clear and specific directive on what action the AI should take. Be precise about the task or question.  
*Example:* "Explain how REST APIs work in simple terms."

**Context**  
Include relevant background information, constraints, or situational details that help the AI understand the scenario.  
*Example:* "The audience is new college graduates with no prior coding experience."

**Example**  
Offer a sample of the desired output format, style, or structure to guide the AIâ€™s response.  
*Example:* "Format your answer as a step-by-step tutorial with headings and bullet points."

> **Purpose:** Improve the quality and relevance of AI-generated content through structured prompting.

## R.I.C.E. for Project Prioritization (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort)

Also known as the **RICE scoring model**, this framework is widely used in product management to evaluate and prioritize initiatives, features, or experiments based on quantifiable criteria.

### Components:

**Reach**  
Estimate the number of people or systems that will be affected by the project within a given time frame (e.g., per month).  
*Measured numerically (e.g., 500 users, 10 teams).*

**Impact**  
Assess the potential effect of the project on users or business goals if successful. Often scored on a scale (e.g., 0.25 = minimal, 1 = high, 3 = massive).  
*Example:* "This feature could reduce user onboarding time by 40%."

**Confidence**  
Reflect the level of certainty in your Reach, Impact, and Effort estimates. Expressed as a percentage (e.g., 80% confidence), or scaled (high/medium/low).  
*Used to adjust for uncertainty in predictions.*

**Effort**  
Estimate the total resources required to complete the project, typically measured in person-months or team weeks.  
*Includes development, design, testing, and coordination.*

### Scoring Formula:

$$
\text{RICE Score} = \frac{\text{Reach} \times \text{Impact} \times \text{Confidence}}{\text{Effort}}
$$

Projects are then ranked by their RICE score to determine implementation priority.

> **Purpose:** Enable data-informed decision-making when prioritizing product roadmaps and initiatives.
