please think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options to fix the following issues and concerns to enhance user experience and to enhance security, before choosing the best option or approach to implement the enhancements. first carefully review all the project files in the current project directory, then think deeply and thoroughly to explore the application's current architect, its design, any issues or potential defects related to logic, coding, functional flow before formulating your detailed execution plan.

remember, you are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You will think deeply and thoroughly to explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal one. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

1. **In-Memory Storage Limitation**: The current implementation uses an in-memory storage option which is not suitable for production use as data will be lost on server restart. Propose to use local Postgresql database as storage.

2. **Incomplete Error Handling**: Some edge cases may not be properly handled, particularly around payment processing and session expiration. need to carefully and thoughtfully address these concerns.

3. **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Enhance the cruise search with more advanced filtering options.

4. **User Reviews and Ratings**: Allow authenticated users to leave reviews and ratings for cruises they have booked.

5. **Wishlist Functionality**: Allow users to save cruises to a wishlist for future reference.

6. **Booking Modifications**: Enable users to modify their bookings within certain constraints.

7. **Loyalty Program**: Implement a loyalty points system for repeat customers.
