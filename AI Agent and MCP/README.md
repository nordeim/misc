Your AI chatbot or coding agent can browse the web to search for relevant documentation related to its task. Using tools like Chrome, it can update itself with the latest information.  

chrome-devtools-mcp lets your coding agent (such as Gemini, Claude, Cursor or Copilot) control and inspect a live Chrome browser. It acts as a Model-Context-Protocol (MCP) server, giving your AI coding assistant access to the full power of Chrome DevTools for reliable automation, in-depth debugging, and performance analysis.

Please use chrome-devtools-mcp to browse GitHub repo at URL link https://github.com/nordeim/ms-agent-framework/tree/main/python and create a programming guide for a useful AI agent using chat as a trigger, OpenAI as LLM, to retrieve the most recent 10 unread emails and give a summary of them as output.  

Awesome job! Please think deeper and think harder to thoroughly and carefully explore how best to implement the following features. then meticulously create an execution plan with integrated checklist. Review and validate the plan before proceeding cautiously to execute.
