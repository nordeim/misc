### Comprehensive Practical Web Architecture Stack Proposal for a Modern, Responsive Luxury E-commerce Website Using LAMP and Laravel with MariaDB

---

#### **Abstract**

This paper presents a comprehensive proposal for a modern, high-performance, and scalable e-commerce website architecture using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL/MariaDB, PHP) alongside Laravel, a PHP framework. The goal is to design a responsive luxury e-commerce platform that is both visually appealing and highly performant, leveraging the best practices in modern web development. The stack will include a combination of cutting-edge technologies like Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire, and Artisan CLI to ensure a smooth development process, ease of scaling, and maintainability.

### **1. Introduction**

Building a luxury e-commerce platform requires an architecture that emphasizes performance, scalability, security, and a rich user experience. This proposal recommends using the **LAMP stack**, complemented by **Laravel**, which is a PHP framework known for its elegant syntax, robust features, and developer productivity. In addition, modern web technologies such as **Tailwind CSS**, **Alpine.js**, and **Livewire** will ensure that the platform is responsive, fast, and highly interactive.

The architecture is designed to scale efficiently, using **MariaDB** as the database layer, leveraging Docker containers to isolate and standardize the environment. We'll also walk through the entire stack setup process on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, making it an easy-to-follow guide for developers.

### **2. Proposed Web Architecture Stack**

#### **2.1 Core Technologies**

* **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
* **Web Server**: Apache 2.4
* **PHP Framework**: Laravel 12
* **Database**: MariaDB 11.8
* **Frontend**: Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Livewire
* **Development Tools**: Composer, Artisan CLI
* **Containerization**: Docker

#### **2.2 System Architecture Overview**

1. **Frontend (Client-Side)**

   * **HTML/CSS**: Standard HTML5 semantics with Tailwind CSS for a responsive, utility-first approach.
   * **JavaScript**: Alpine.js for reactive UI components and Livewire for server-side interactivity, avoiding complex JavaScript frameworks.

2. **Backend (Server-Side)**

   * **Laravel**: Serving as the core backend framework, managing routing, authentication, data handling, and API integration.
   * **Apache 2.4**: A reliable and well-known web server.
   * **PHP 8.4**: Latest PHP version for performance optimizations, security improvements, and better compatibility with Laravel 12.

3. **Database Layer**

   * **MariaDB 11.8**: A high-performance, open-source relational database compatible with MySQL but with better optimizations and features for modern web applications.

4. **Containerization**

   * **Docker**: Used to create isolated development and production environments, ensuring consistency across various deployment stages.

### **3. Detailed Stack Explanation**

#### **3.1 Laravel 12 & Apache Setup**

* **Why Laravel?**
  Laravel is a feature-rich framework that is ideal for large-scale applications like e-commerce websites. It offers built-in tools like Eloquent ORM for database management, authentication, routing, and request handling, which simplifies development and reduces boilerplate code.

* **Why Apache?**
  Apache is highly customizable, reliable, and has widespread support. It's commonly used in LAMP stack applications, providing great performance for web servers.

#### **3.2 MariaDB**

MariaDB is the recommended database management system, offering high performance, advanced clustering options, and better compatibility with modern PHP applications.

* **Advantages**: Fast indexing, improved security features, ACID compliance, and scalability.

#### **3.3 Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS provides utility-first CSS, allowing designers and developers to build highly customized and responsive UIs without writing extensive custom CSS. It aligns perfectly with Laravelâ€™s philosophy of developer productivity.

#### **3.4 Alpine.js & Livewire**

* **Alpine.js**: Ideal for adding interactivity to the frontend with minimal JavaScript. Alpine.js will handle the interactive components like dropdowns, modals, and carousels.

* **Livewire**: A full-stack framework that enables real-time updates and interactions without the need for a heavy front-end framework like Vue or React. This makes it an excellent choice for interactive luxury e-commerce features like dynamic pricing, real-time stock updates, and cart management.

#### **3.5 Docker Containers**

Docker enables environment isolation, ensuring that the e-commerce website runs consistently across different stages of development, testing, and production. Each component (PHP, MariaDB, Apache) will run in its own container, making the stack highly portable.

### **4. Installation Guide**

#### **4.1 Setting Up Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**

Ensure that Ubuntu 24.04 LTS is installed and updated with the following:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

#### **4.2 Installing Docker**

1. Install Docker on your system:

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

2. Enable and start Docker:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

3. Verify Docker installation:

```bash
docker --version
```

#### **4.3 Installing Docker Compose**

Docker Compose simplifies the management of multi-container Docker applications.

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

Verify installation:

```bash
docker-compose --version
```

#### **4.4 Creating a Docker Compose Configuration**

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to set up the entire stack. The configuration includes Apache, PHP, MariaDB, and a Laravel application.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: php:8.4-apache
    container_name: laravel_web
    volumes:
      - ./html:/var/www/html
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    networks:
      - laravel_net
    environment:
      - APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT=/var/www/html/public

  db:
    image: mariadb:11.8
    container_name: laravel_db
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: rootpassword
      MYSQL_DATABASE: laravel_db
    volumes:
      - mariadb_data:/var/lib/mysql
    networks:
      - laravel_net

  app:
    image: laravel:latest
    container_name: laravel_app
    depends_on:

docker-compose up -d
```

3. **Access the Laravel Application**:

Visit the application at `http://localhost` on your browser to verify that the Laravel application is running.

#### **4.6 Database Setup in Laravel**

* Configure the `.env` file to connect Laravel to MariaDB:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=laravel_db
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=rootpassword
```

* Run migrations to set up the initial database schema:

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```
