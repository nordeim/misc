The proposed architecture leverages a combination of mature and cutting-edge technologies to deliver a superior e-commerce experience. The TALL stack, in particular, has gained significant traction for its ability to facilitate rapid development of dynamic and interactive applications. 

### 2.1. Core Stack: LAMP  

- Linux (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS): A stable, secure, and well-supported operating system that forms the foundation of our stack.  
- Apache 2.4: A powerful and flexible web server with a rich ecosystem of modules and extensive documentation.  
- MariaDB 11.8: A high-performance, open-source relational database that is a drop-in replacement for MySQL. It offers significant performance improvements, making it ideal for e-commerce applications with large datasets and high transaction volumes.  
- PHP 8.4: The latest version of the popular scripting language, offering significant performance enhancements and new features that streamline development.  

### 2.2. Application Stack: Laravel & The TALL Stack  
- Laravel 12: The latest version of the popular PHP framework, known for its elegant syntax, robust features, and extensive ecosystem. It provides a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable web applications.  
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development and easy customization, perfect for creating a bespoke luxury aesthetic.  
- Alpine.js: A lightweight JavaScript framework for adding interactivity to the frontend without the complexity of larger frameworks. It is ideal for creating dynamic UI elements like dropdowns, tabs, and modals.  
- Livewire: A full-stack framework for Laravel that enables the creation of dynamic interfaces using PHP, reducing the need for complex JavaScript. It is perfect for features like real-time search, product filtering, and shopping cart updates.
