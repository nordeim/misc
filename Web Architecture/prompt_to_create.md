## 1. Concept, Vision & UX Blueprint

### 1.1 Guiding Principles & Design Philosophy

For a website serving older adults, caregivers, and families, the UX must emphasize:

* **Accessibility & readability**: large fonts, high contrast, ample spacing, clear interactive elements
* **Simplicity & clarity**: minimal clutter, clear navigation, no cognitive overload
* **Emotional reassurance & trust**: warm images, human faces, testimonials, staff profiles
* **Ease of action**: booking, inquiry, video viewing with minimal friction
* **Responsiveness & mobile first**: many users will access via tablets or phones
* **Progressive enhancement**: mimic traditional websites for all users, but layering interactivity (via Livewire / Alpine) for enhanced UX
* **Scalable modular structure**: as services grow, new content/pages can be added with minimal refactor

Design inspirations:

* Many adult day services / senior service sites focus on clearly laying out services, staff, FAQs, and contact forms. ([IlluminAge Communication Partners][1])
* A design with large hero images (showing real people), section anchors to “Services”, “Programs”, “Videos”, “Book a Visit”, “Resources / Caregiver Info”
* Strong emphasis on **accessibility compliance**: WCAG 2.1 A/AA, skip‑to-content, aria labels, alt texts etc. ([IlluminAge Communication Partners][2])

### 1.2 Personas & Key User Journeys

**Primary personas / audiences:**

| Persona                            | Needs / Goals                                                                  | Key Tasks                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Family caregiver (adult child)     | Quickly understand the services, check eligibility, see schedule, book a visit | Browse “Services”, view “Videos / gallery”, check availability, complete booking or contact |
| Prospective adult client           | Understand daily activities, see what to expect, view gallery/videos           | View “A Day in Our Center”, staff intro, guided tour video, FAQs                            |
| Referral agencies / social workers | Verify credentials, view program structure, access resources                   | View “About Us”, accreditation, staff qualifications, downloadable resources                |
| Admin / internal staff             | Manage bookings, upload videos, manage content                                 | Admin dashboard, content CMS, reports                                                       |

**Key user flows:**

1. **From home → service page → check schedule → book a slot / contact**
2. **Watch video / virtual tour → decide → fill inquiry / booking form**
3. **Access caregiver resources (PDFs, FAQs, blog posts)**
4. **View staff profiles / meet the team → trust building**
5. **Admin logs in → sees dashboard → manage bookings, manage content, view analytics**

## 6. Non‑Functional & Operational Considerations

- **Testing & Quality Assurance**  
  - Unit tests (models, business logic)  
  - Feature / Dusk tests for critical flows  
  - Accessibility tests / audit tools  
  - Load / performance tests on booking / media pages  

- **Security**  
  - Validate / sanitize all inputs

  - File upload restrictions, virus scanning  
  - Rate limiting for booking, login brute force  
  - Role-based access  
  - HTTPS only  

- **Performance / Caching**  
  - Use caching (e.g. Laravel cache) for repeated queries (service list, media)  
  - Optimize images (compression, responsive src sets)  
  - Use lazy loading for media  
  - HTTP caching headers  
  - Possibly a CDN for media delivery  

- **Logging & Monitoring**  
  - Error logging via Sentry / Laravel logging  
  - Performance metrics (New Relic, etc.)

## 10. How Claude Code (or coding agent) Can Execute

1. **Phase-by-phase execution**: Each phase is self-contained; the agent should complete and test one phase before proceeding to the next.  
2. **Use migrations & seeders**: The agent can generate initial dummy data to test content flows.  
3. **Livewire & Alpine scaffolding**: Use standard patterns for CRUD, reactive components, modal forms.  
4. **Test-driven approach**: For each critical flow (booking, media upload), write tests first.  
5. **CI / build scripts**: The agent should maintain a CI script (e.g. GitHub Actions) to run tests, lint, build assets.  
6. **Config management**: Use `.env` files for environment-specific config; don’t hardcode secrets.  
7. **Graceful error handling**: Provide fallback views for missing media, 404s, etc.  
8. **Iterative UI / accessibility enhancements**: After functional features, refine styling, ARIA, performance.  
9. **Deployment manifests / scripts**: The agent should generate a Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifest for production.  
10. **Documentation generation**: At end of each phase, produce a short markdown summary and API docs.

---

The PRD should give a clear, phase-wise path for the coding agent to build out the complete website, from zero to launch, in manageable, testable stages.
