Alright Sepnet — let’s zoom in on that mysterious word **“logits”** and make it crystal clear where it fits in the LLM pipeline you’ve been building and exploring.

## **What are logits?**

In the simplest terms:

> **Logits are the raw, unnormalized scores a model produces for each possible next token before turning them into probabilities.**

They’re the **direct output** of the model’s final layer — one number per vocabulary entry — and they can be positive or negative, large or small.

---

## **Why not just probabilities?**

Neural networks don’t directly output probabilities.  
Instead, they output **arbitrary real‑valued scores** (logits).  
We then pass these through a **softmax** function to turn them into a probability distribution over the vocabulary.

---

## **Where logits fit in the inference flow**

Let’s revisit your 3‑step inference pipeline with more detail:

1. **Token ID → Embedding vector**  
   - You look up the token ID in the embedding table.  
   - Example: token ID `523` → vector of length `embedding_dim` (e.g., 64 floats in our toy model).

2. **Embedding vector → Transformer/LSTM layers → Logits**  
   - The embedding vector flows through the model’s layers (attention, feed‑forward, etc.).  
   - The final layer is a **linear projection** from the model’s hidden size to the vocabulary size.  
   - Output shape: `[batch_size, sequence_length, vocab_size]`  
     - For each position in the sequence, you get one score per token in the vocabulary.  
     - These scores are the **logits**.

3. **Logits → Sampling / Greedy decoding → Next token ID**  
   - Apply **softmax** to logits for the last position to get probabilities.  
   - Use a decoding strategy:
     - **Greedy**: pick the token with the highest probability.
     - **Sampling**: pick randomly according to the probability distribution (optionally with temperature, top‑k, top‑p).
   - The chosen token ID becomes the next input, and the loop continues.

## **Concrete example**

Let’s say your vocab size is `5` (toy example):

**Logits** for the last position might be:
```
[ 2.1,  -0.5,  0.3,  1.2,  -1.0 ]
```

These are **not** probabilities — they can be any real numbers.

**Softmax** turns them into probabilities:
```
[ 0.49,  0.06,  0.09,  0.33,  0.03 ]
```

- Token 0 has the highest probability (0.49) → Greedy decoding would pick token ID `0`.
- Sampling could still pick others, depending on temperature and randomness.

---

## **Why logits are useful beyond decoding**

- **Temperature scaling**: You divide logits by `temperature` before softmax to control randomness.
- **Top‑k / Top‑p filtering**: You can zero out logits for less likely tokens before softmax.
- **Loss calculation during training**: Cross‑entropy loss works directly on logits (it applies softmax internally).

## **Visual mental model**

```
[Token IDs] → [Embedding Layer] → [Transformer/LSTM Layers] → [Logits]
                                                           ↓
                                                      Softmax
                                                           ↓
                                                  Probabilities
                                                           ↓
                                               Sampling / Greedy
                                                           ↓
                                                     Next Token ID
```

💡 **Key takeaway:**  
- **Logits** = raw scores for each token in the vocab.  
- They’re the bridge between the model’s internal representation and the final choice of the next token.  
- You can manipulate logits (temperature, top‑k/p) to shape the model’s output style before turning them into probabilities.

If you’d like, I can **extend our streaming debug code** so that for each step you also see:
- The **logits vector** for the top few candidate tokens
- Their corresponding **probabilities**
- Which token was chosen and why

That would let you watch the *entire* decision‑making process in real time.  
Do you want me to build that next?
