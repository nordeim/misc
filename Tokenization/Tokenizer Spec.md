Alright — let’s design a **production‑ready tokenizer spec** that’s tuned for:

- **English** (both British and American spelling/usage)  
- **Numbers** (integers, decimals, formatted numbers)  
- **General text** (news, docs, chat, technical writing)  
- **Common programming languages** (Python, JavaScript, PHP, Java, TypeScript, C, C++, Rust, Go)  

This will be a **single unified tokenizer** so the same model can handle prose, code, and mixed content without switching tokenizers.

---

## **Tokenizer Specification**

### **1. Algorithm**
- **SentencePiece BPE** (Byte‑Pair Encoding) with **byte‑fallback**  
  - **Why:**  
    - BPE compresses frequent English words and code keywords well.  
    - Byte‑fallback ensures *any* Unicode sequence (emoji, rare symbol, unusual identifier) is representable without `<unk>`.  
    - SentencePiece avoids external pre‑tokenization, so whitespace, punctuation, and code indentation are preserved exactly.

---

### **2. Vocabulary Size**
- **64,000 tokens**  
  - **Rationale:**  
    - Large enough to keep common English words and code keywords as single tokens.  
    - Small enough to keep embedding matrix size reasonable for LLM training.  
    - Balances compression for prose and code.

---

### **3. Normalization**
- **Unicode NFKC normalization**  
  - Converts visually identical characters to a canonical form (avoids homoglyph issues).  
- **Preserve case**  
  - Important for code (case‑sensitive identifiers) and proper nouns in English.  
- **Preserve accents and diacritics**  
  - Needed for names, borrowed words, and multilingual snippets.  
- **No whitespace collapsing**  
  - Tabs, spaces, and newlines preserved exactly — critical for code formatting.

### **4. Special Tokens**
| Token | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `<bos>` | Beginning of sequence |
| `<eos>` | End of sequence |
| `<pad>` | Padding |
| `<unk>` | Rarely used due to byte‑fallback |
| `<nl>` | Explicit newline marker (optional — can also just use `\n`) |
| `<tab>` | Explicit tab marker (optional — can also just use `\t`) |
| `<sys>` | System prompt marker |
| `<usr>` | User prompt marker |
| `<asst>` | Assistant output marker |

### **5. Training Corpus Composition**
**Target ratio:** ~60% natural language, ~40% code

- **Natural language (60%)**
  - British & American English corpora (balanced mix)
  - News, Wikipedia, books, technical documentation
  - Conversational/chat data
  - Markdown and HTML docs

- **Code (40%)**
  - Python, JavaScript, PHP, Java, TypeScript, C, C++, Rust, Go
  - Include:
    - Standard library code
    - Popular open‑source repos
    - Docstrings, comments, READMEs
    - Mixed prose/code files (e.g., Jupyter notebooks, Markdown with code fences)

---

### **6. Tokenization Rules**
- **Word boundaries:** Use `▁` (U+2581) to mark spaces in SentencePiece output.  
- **Numbers:** Keep frequent patterns as single tokens (e.g., `0`, `1`, `10`, `100`, `3.14`, `1,000`).  
- **Code identifiers:** Preserve common keywords (`if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `class`, `function`, `return`, etc.) as single tokens.  
- **Operators & punctuation:** Keep as single tokens (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`, `===`, `->`, `::`, `{`, `}`, `;`).  
- **String literals:** Allow frequent patterns like `"`, `'`, `"""`, `'''` to be single tokens.  
- **Comments:** Preserve `#`, `//`, `/*`, `*/` as atomic tokens.

### **7. Example Tokenization**

#### Input:
```
To be, or not to be: that is the question.
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { printf("Hello, world!\n"); }
```

#### Output (SentencePiece BPE style with `▁` for space):
```
▁To ▁be , ▁or ▁not ▁to ▁be : ▁that ▁is ▁the ▁question .
for ▁( int ▁i ▁= ▁0 ; ▁i ▁< ▁10 ; ▁i ++ ) ▁{ ▁printf ( " Hello , ▁world ! \n " ) ; ▁}
```

- **English:** Common words are single tokens; punctuation is separate.  
- **Code:** Keywords (`for`, `int`, `printf`) are single tokens; operators and punctuation are preserved exactly; numbers are atomic.

---

### **8. Evaluation Metrics**
- **Average tokens per English word:** ~1.05–1.15  
- **Average tokens per code keyword:** 1.0  
- **Round‑trip fidelity:** 100% for all test cases (including whitespace and Unicode)  
- **Compression ratio:** ~3–4 characters per token for mixed corpus

---

### **9. Why this spec works**
- **English coverage:** Balanced British/American corpora ensure spelling variants (`color`/`colour`, `organize`/`organise`) are tokenized efficiently.  
- **Numbers:** Frequent numeric patterns are atomic, reducing fragmentation in math/code.  
- **Code coverage:** Preserves syntax, indentation, and common idioms across multiple languages.  
- **Future‑proof:** Byte‑fallback ensures no `<unk>` for unseen Unicode, making it safe for logs, URLs, emojis, and new programming syntax.

If you want, I can **also give you a ready‑to‑run `spm_train` command** with all the right flags and a **corpus composition plan** so you could actually train this tokenizer exactly as specified. That would make it fully reproducible. Would you like me to prepare that next?
