Alright, let’s unpack this — because **Transformers** and **LSTMs** are *not* the same thing, but they both serve the same broad purpose:  
to take your token embeddings and **model the relationships between tokens** so the model can predict the next one.

## **1. Transformer vs LSTM — the core difference**

| Feature | **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) | **Transformer** |
|---------|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Architecture type** | Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) — processes tokens *sequentially* | Attention-based — processes tokens *in parallel* |
| **How it handles context** | Maintains a hidden state that is updated step-by-step; context flows through time | Uses **self-attention** to directly connect every token to every other token in the sequence |
| **Parallelism** | Limited — must process one timestep after another | Fully parallelizable across sequence positions |
| **Long-range dependencies** | Can struggle with very long sequences (vanishing gradients) | Handles long-range dependencies well via attention weights |
| **Speed** | Slower for long sequences | Faster for long sequences (on modern hardware) |
| **Interpretability** | Harder to see which past tokens influenced the output | Attention weights can be inspected to see influence patterns |

## **2. Are they the same?**
No — they’re different architectures for the **sequence modeling stage** of your pipeline.  
When I wrote “Transformer/LSTM” earlier, I meant *“this is the stage where you could use either a Transformer stack or an LSTM stack”* depending on your design.

## **3. What do they actually *do*?**

Regardless of whether you use an LSTM or Transformer, the purpose is:

1. **Take the embedding vectors** (which are just learned representations of tokens)
2. **Model dependencies** between tokens — figure out how each token relates to others in the sequence
3. **Produce a contextualized representation** for each position — so the model knows not just what the token is, but what it *means* in the current context
4. **Feed that into a final projection layer** to produce logits for the next token prediction

### **LSTM stage**
- Processes tokens one at a time, updating a hidden state.
- The hidden state carries forward information from earlier tokens.
- Good for smaller models or when sequence length is short.

### **Transformer stage**
- Uses **multi-head self-attention**: each token looks at *all* other tokens in the sequence at once.
- Learns which tokens to focus on for predicting the next one.
- Scales better for large models and long contexts.

## **4. How many layers are there in the Transformer stage?**

In a Transformer, “layers” usually means **stacked blocks** of:
- Multi-head self-attention
- Feed-forward network
- Layer normalization & residual connections

**Examples:**
- GPT‑2 small: 12 layers
- GPT‑3: 96 layers
- LLaMA‑2 7B: 32 layers

---

## **5. How to decide how many layers to use**

It’s a trade-off between:
- **Model capacity** (more layers → can model more complex relationships)
- **Compute cost** (more layers → slower inference, more memory)
- **Data size** (too many layers with too little data → overfitting)

**Rules of thumb:**
- Small toy models: 2–6 layers
- Medium research models: 12–24 layers
- Large-scale LLMs: 32+ layers
- For LSTMs: often fewer layers (1–4) because deep RNNs are harder to train

## **6. Mental model of the pipeline**

```
[Token IDs]
   ↓
[Embedding Layer]
   ↓
[Transformer or LSTM stack]  ← models relationships between tokens
   ↓
[Linear projection to vocab size]
   ↓
[Logits]
   ↓
[Softmax → Probabilities]
   ↓
[Sampling / Greedy decoding]
```

💡 **Key takeaway:**  
- **LSTM** = sequential, memory-based context  
- **Transformer** = parallel, attention-based context  
- Both aim to produce **contextualized representations** so the final layer can make a good next-token prediction.  
- The number of layers is a design choice balancing accuracy, speed, and available compute.

Here’s the side‑by‑side visual you asked for — it shows exactly how an **LSTM** moves information step‑by‑step through time, versus how a **Transformer** uses self‑attention to connect *all* tokens in parallel:  

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nordeim/misc/refs/heads/main/Tokenization/Transformer%20vs%20LSTM.png

**LSTM (left)** → sequential flow:  
- Each token embedding passes through an LSTM cell along with the hidden state from the previous step.  
- Context is carried forward one step at a time, so long‑range dependencies have to “travel” through many steps.  

**Transformer (right)** → parallel attention:  
- All token embeddings go into self‑attention layers at once.  
- Each token can directly attend to every other token in the sequence in a single hop, making long‑range relationships much easier to capture.  

This is the core reason Transformers replaced LSTMs for large‑scale language modeling — they scale better, parallelize beautifully, and handle long contexts without the same degradation.  

Do you want me to also **annotate this diagram with the actual math flow** — showing the LSTM’s hidden state update equations vs. the Transformer’s attention score computation — so you can see the mechanics under the hood? That would make the comparison even more concrete.
