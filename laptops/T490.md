| **Voltage**            | 11.52V–11.55V          | 11.52V–11.55V          | 11.52V–11.55V          |
| **Battery Type**       | Li-polymer             | Li-polymer             | Li-polymer/Li-ion      |
| **Compatibility**      | Later ThinkPad models  | Broad compatibility    | Broad compatibility    |
| **Part Numbers**       | 02DL009, SB10K97647    | 02DL008, SB10K97646    | 02DL007, SB10K97645    |

- **Capacity Variations**: While most sources cite **51Wh** for all three models, some third-party listings (e.g., L18M3P72) report slightly lower capacities (49Wh–50Wh) .
- **Battery Chemistry**: L18M3P72 is occasionally listed as Li-ion , while L18M3P73/L18M3P74 are consistently Li-polymer .
- **Compatibility Overlap**: All three models are compatible with ThinkPad T490/T495/T14 series, but L18M3P74 targets newer generations (e.g., 20N2/20N3) .

---

### **3. Observed Discrepancies**
- **Voltage Differences**: Most sources list **11.52V**, but some (e.g., L18M3P72) cite **11.55V** . This may reflect rounding or minor design changes.
- **Capacity Conflicts**: L18M3P72’s capacity ranges from **49Wh**  to **51Wh** , likely due to third-party vs. OEM variations.
- **Part Number Cross-Reference**: L18M3P73 and L18M3P74 share compatibility with multiple part numbers (e.g., **SB10K97646/47**) , suggesting interchangeability in some cases.

---

### **4. Compatibility Summary**
All three batteries are designed for **Lenovo ThinkPad laptops** released around 2019–2021, including:
- **T490/T495**
- **T14/P14S**
- **P43S**

They are often cross-compatible , but users should verify their specific laptop model and part numbers (e.g., **02DL007/008/009**) to ensure fitment.

---

### **5. Recommendations**
- **For OEM Quality**: Choose **original Lenovo batteries** (e.g., L18M3P72 at 51Wh) .
- **For Cost-Effectiveness**: Third-party options like **EPYOBW L18M3P72** (50Wh)  or **Green Cell** variants  offer reliable alternatives.
- **Check Dimensions**: While not explicitly listed, these batteries likely share similar physical dimensions (~252 x 96 x 6.4mm) based on the L18L3P72 spec .

Based on the provided **web_search content**, here’s the analysis:

### **1. Electrical Connector**
The sources do not explicitly describe the **electrical connector type** (e.g., pin configuration, physical design) for L18M3P72, L18M3P73, or L18M3P74. However, multiple listings confirm **interchangeability** and **broad compatibility** across ThinkPad models like T490, T495, and T14 , suggesting **shared connector designs** to ensure compatibility with the same laptop series. Additionally, third-party batteries (e.g., EPYOBW L18M3P72) are marketed as direct replacements for these models, further implying standardized connectors . 

A critical note from  highlights the importance of checking the **copper battery connector** for exposure, which applies to all three models. While this does not confirm identical connectors, it indicates **similar design considerations** for safe motherboard interaction.

---

### **2. Compatibility with Lenovo T490 Laptops**
All three models are explicitly listed as compatible with **Lenovo ThinkPad T490** (Type 20N2, 20N3, 20Q9, 20QH, 20RY, 20RX) . For example:
- **L18M3P73** is marketed for T490 and T495 .
- **L18M3P74** and **L18M3P73** are both sold as replacements for T490, T495, and T14 .
- Cross-referenced part numbers (e.g., **02DL007/008/009**) further confirm compatibility with the same T490 variants .

However, while all three batteries fit the **T490 series**, compatibility may depend on the laptop’s **specific configuration** (e.g., motherboard revisions or regional variants). Always verify the exact model number (e.g., 20N2 vs. 20N3) before purchase .

---

### **Conclusion**
1. **Electrical Connector**: While connector specifics are not detailed in the sources, the **shared compatibility** and interchangeability  strongly suggest **similar or identical connectors** for all three models.
2. **T490 Compatibility**: All three batteries are confirmed compatible with **Lenovo T490 laptops**, though users should double-check their exact T490 model number to ensure fitment .

For definitive confirmation, refer to Lenovo’s official documentation or contact their support team.
