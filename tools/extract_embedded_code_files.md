I need to create a Python script that extracts code blocks from a markdown or text file and saves them to separate files. The script should:

1. Prompt for an input filename
2. Look for code blocks enclosed in triple backticks (```ts, ```py, etc.)
3. For each code block:
   - Extract the filename from the first line (which starts with "// ")
   - Create the necessary directory structure
   - Save the code block content to that filename

Let me design a clear solution with proper error handling:

1. First, I'll read the input file line by line
2. I'll track when we enter and exit code blocks
3. For each code block, I'll extract the filename and content
4. I'll create the necessary directories and save each file
5. I'll handle various edge cases (file not found, invalid format, etc.)

The implementation should be robust and handle all requirements correctly.

Would you like me to explain or break down the code?
