## 🌍 Popular Open Container Registries

Here are the most widely used places to upload and share your custom Docker images:

| Registry | Highlights | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| **[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)** | The default and most popular registry. Public repos are free, private repos limited on free tier. | Best for open sharing and community visibility. |
| **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)** | Integrated with GitHub repos, supports fine‑grained permissions. | Great if your code is already on GitHub. |
| **GitLab Container Registry** | Built into GitLab CI/CD. | Ideal if you use GitLab pipelines. |
| **Quay.io (by Red Hat)** | Strong security scanning, enterprise features. | Popular in enterprise/Red Hat ecosystems. |
| **Amazon ECR / Google Artifact Registry / Azure Container Registry** | Cloud‑native registries tied to AWS/GCP/Azure. | Best if you deploy to those clouds. |

👉 For open source and easy sharing, **Docker Hub** is still the most common choice.

## 🚀 How to Push Your Custom Image to Docker Hub

1. **Log in to Docker Hub** (create an account if you don’t have one):
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Tag your image** with your Docker Hub username and repo name:
   ```bash
   docker tag alpine-dev-claude-dev:latest your-dockerhub-username/alpine-dev-claude-dev:latest
   ```

3. **Push it**:
   ```bash
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/alpine-dev-claude-dev:latest
   ```

4. **Share it**:  
   Others can now pull it with:
   ```bash
   docker pull your-dockerhub-username/alpine-dev-claude-dev:latest
   ```

## 🔐 Pro Tips

- Add a **README** on Docker Hub to explain usage (`ssh` access, default user/pass, installed tools).
- Use **semantic tags** (`:v1.0`, `:latest`) so you can publish updates without breaking old workflows.
- If you want to keep it private but still share with teammates, Docker Hub supports private repos (limited free, unlimited paid).
