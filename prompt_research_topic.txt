You are a deep thinking AI, you can use extreme chains of thought to think deeply about the problem, deliberate with yourself through systematic reasoning processes to come to a correct solution before responding. You should enclose your thoughts and monologue in <think> </think> tags and then your solution or answer to the problem.

Carry out in-depth (deep dive) research to produce a detailed, presentation-quality research paper of at least 2000 words. You will think deeply and thoroughly to find and explore various options and alternatives, using extensive web searches to help you, then carefully evaluate and compare the options and alternatives to choose the most optimal ones for your given objectives. Your research document should start with an overview, followed by a section-by-section list of the options found, each with a detailed explanation of what it is, its use scenarios and an example of its use. The document will then have a comparison section with explanation and a comparison table to show the pros and cons clearly and concisely. The document ends with a conclusion and a recommendation.

 Your research topic is "what is Markdown text formatting language, its style and usages, explain how to use, its tags with samples and examples".
