Yes, that command is valid and should work as you intend. Here’s what happens with each option:

- **`-u www-data`** specifies the target user as `www-data`.
- **`-i`** simulates an initial login session for `www-data`. This causes the shell to read the appropriate login configuration files and, importantly, changes the working directory to the target user’s home directory.
- **`-H`** sets the `$HOME` environment variable to the home directory of `www-data` (i.e., `/var/www/www-data`), though with `-i` this is typically handled automatically.

By running:

```bash
sudo -H -i -u www-data pwd
```

the shell for `www-data` will start in its home directory, and the command `pwd` will print that directory—commonly `/var/www/www-data`, provided that is the defined home directory in `/etc/passwd`.

This approach ensures your command reflects the environment of `www-data` accurately. If you have any more questions about user environment settings or other Linux configurations, feel free to ask!

The command:

```bash
sudo -E -u www-data <command>
```

tells `sudo` to run `<command>` as the user `www-data` and to **preserve your current environment variables** (with the `-E` flag). Normally, when you run `sudo`, many of your environment variables are reset for security reasons. The `-E` flag overrides that behavior, allowing your environment (or at least the ones permitted by the sudoers configuration) to be passed along to the new process.

**Key Points:**

- **`-E` (Preserve Environment):** Instead of wiping out your environment variables when switching users, this flag keeps them, which can be useful if your command requires specific settings (like a custom `PATH` or locale variables).

- **`-u www-data` (Run as Specific User):** This part tells `sudo` to execute the command as the `www-data` user. The `www-data` account is typically used to run web server processes.

**Example Usage:**

- If you want to start an interactive shell as `www-data` while preserving your current environment, you might run:

  ```bash
  sudo -E -u www-data bash
  ```

- If you simply want to print the current working directory as `www-data` (bearing in mind that it will initially inherit the directory from where you run the command, unless your environment changes it), you could execute:

  ```bash
  sudo -E -u www-data pwd
  ```

Keep in mind that the actual environment seen by the process might still be influenced by settings in the `/etc/sudoers` file (such as which variables are allowed from your environment). Always double-check these configurations if preserving specific variables is crucial for your task.

This should clarify what `sudo -E -u www-data` does and help you use it safely and effectively. If you're curious about security implications or further nuances—perhaps how `env_reset` and `env_keep` work in `/etc/sudoers`—I’d be happy to dive deeper.
