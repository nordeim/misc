To perform a full or distribution upgrade in Ubuntu using the `apt` command, follow these steps:

1. **Update Package Lists:**  
   First, refresh your package index to ensure you have the latest information from your repositories.  
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. **Perform the Upgrade:**  
   Use the `full-upgrade` command (or its equivalent `dist-upgrade` in older usage) to upgrade your installed packages. This command intelligently handles changing dependencies, meaning it may remove obsolete packages to allow the upgrade to succeed.  
   ```bash
   sudo apt full-upgrade
   ```
   If you prefer or if you're on an older setup, you can also use:  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
   ```

**A few tips to keep in mind:**

- **Difference from `apt upgrade`:**  
  The ordinary `sudo apt upgrade` command will only install updates that do not require removing any packages. If a package upgrade needs extra changes—like installing new dependencies or removing conflicting ones—`apt upgrade` will hold back that package. In contrast, `full-upgrade` (or `dist-upgrade`) takes a more aggressive approach, ensuring all available updates are applied by resolving or removing package conflicts automatically.

- **When Upgrading a Release:**  
  Note that if you are looking to upgrade your entire Ubuntu distribution (for example, upgrading from Ubuntu 20.04 to 22.04), the recommended tool is [`do-release-upgrade`](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/en/man1/do-release-upgrade.1.html) rather than using `apt` directly. The `do-release-upgrade` command takes care of several additional steps required for a distribution upgrade.

This upgrade process is essential to keeping your system secure and up to date with the latest software fixes and improvements. Let me know if you’re curious about any specific scenarios, such as handling held-back packages or performing a release upgrade with `do-release-upgrade`—I'd be happy to expand on those topics!
