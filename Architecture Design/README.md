## 1. Introduction

This document articulates the architectural principles, design patterns, and best practices that have proven successful in the SG Point-of-Sale (SG-POS) System. The goal is to serve as a reusable blueprint for future projects seeking to achieve high maintainability, scalability, reliability, and testability. Adhering to these guidelines will enable teams to build robust, enterprise-grade applications with predictable quality and long-term sustainability.

## 2. Core Architectural Principles

### 2.1. Strict Separation of Concerns (SoC)

**Definition:**  
Every component should have a single, well-defined responsibility. The codebase must be divided into logical layers, with each layer only aware of, and interacting with, its immediate neighbors.

**Best Practices:**
- Enforce clear boundaries between UI, business logic, data access, and persistence.
- Prevent leakage of implementation details between layers (e.g., UI should never access database models directly).
- Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for moving data between layers.

---

### 2.2. Layered Architecture Model

**Overview:**  
Adopt a classic four-layer architecture as the backbone of the application:

1. **Presentation Layer (`app/ui`)**  
   - Responsible for the user interface and user interaction.
   - Contains views, dialogs, and widgets.
   - No business logic or data access logic.

2. **Business Logic Layer (`app/business_logic`)**  
   - Contains all the business rules, orchestration, and workflows.
   - Managers coordinate operations and enforce business policies.
   - Uses DTOs to communicate with UI and data access layers.

3. **Data Access Layer (`app/services`)**  
   - Implements the Repository Pattern.
   - Abstracts all direct database interaction.
   - Provides a clean API for CRUD and query operations.

4. **Persistence Layer (`app/models`)**  
   - Defines the database schema using ORM models (e.g., SQLAlchemy).
   - No business logic or data manipulation.

**Benefits:**  
- Simplifies maintenance and onboarding.
- Enhances testability and scalability.
- Ensures unidirectional flow of data and control.

---

### 2.3. Maintainability and Readability First

**Guidelines:**
- Favor code that is easy to read and reason about over clever or overly optimized code.
- Use consistent naming conventions, comprehensive type hints, and detailed docstrings.
- Apply a strict code formatter (e.g., Black) and linter (e.g., Ruff) to enforce code quality.
- Structure the project to mirror the architectural layers (folders reflect boundaries).

---

### 2.4. Unidirectional Data & Control Flow

**Pattern:**  
Data and control always flow from UI → Business Logic → Data Access → Persistence, and results flow back in the reverse order. There is no circular dependency between layers.

**Practices:**
- UI collects input, packages it in DTOs, and sends it to the business logic.
- Business logic enforces rules, invokes services, and returns results.
- Services translate business requests into queries and interact with ORM models.

---

### 2.5. Non-Blocking, Responsive User Experience

**Requirement:**  
The application must never freeze or become unresponsive due to I/O operations.

**Solution:**  
- Use an asynchronous backend (async/await) for all potentially blocking operations.
- Implement an async bridge between the UI event loop (e.g., Qt's main thread) and the backend's async event loop.
- Offload all long-running tasks (database queries, etc.) to a background thread or process and update the UI via thread-safe callbacks (e.g., Qt signals/slots).

---

### 2.6. Dependency Injection (DI) & Central Service Locator

**Pattern:**  
Centralize the creation and lifecycle management of core components (services and managers) in a DI container (e.g., `ApplicationCore`).

**Practices:**
- Provide shared dependencies (database sessions, configuration, etc.) via the DI container.
- Use lazy-loaded properties to instantiate managers and services only when needed.
- Pass the DI container down to views and dialogs, avoiding hard-coded imports and tight coupling.

---

### 2.7. Testability by Design

**Principles:**
- Design every component to be testable in isolation.
- Use DTOs to decouple UI and business logic.
- Structure the test suite to mirror the app structure.
- Use dependency injection to facilitate mocking and stubbing in tests.
- Ensure the test environment is fully isolated (e.g., use in-memory databases, transactional test isolation).

---

### 2.8. Scalability and Extensibility

**Strategies:**
- Keep layers and components decoupled to allow for easy replacement and extension.
- Use interfaces (e.g., abstract base classes) and DTOs to define contracts.
- Design with future cloud, API, or multi-channel extensions in mind (e.g., web, mobile, cloud backend).

---

## 3. Key Design Patterns

### 3.1. Repository Pattern

- Encapsulate all data access logic in services ("repositories").
- UI and business logic never write raw queries or touch ORM models directly.
- Facilitates mocking and swapping of data storage implementations.

### 3.2. DTO (Data Transfer Object) Pattern

- Use Pydantic models (or equivalent) as DTOs to define data contracts between layers.
- Separate DTOs for creation, update, and query operations.
- DTOs ensure validation, type safety, and decoupling from persistence models.

### 3.3. Result Pattern for Error Handling

- Use an explicit `Result` type: return `Success[T]` or `Failure[E]` rather than raising exceptions for predictable business errors.
- Forces calling code to handle both success and failure, leading to more robust, readable flows.
- Catastrophic errors (e.g., configuration failure) should be handled via exceptions; business errors should use `Result`.

### 3.4. Asynchronous UI Bridge

- Implement a background worker thread running an async event loop for backend operations.
- Provide a bridge (e.g., `AsyncBridge`) for submitting coroutines from the UI and receiving results via callbacks or signals.
- Guarantees UI responsiveness and thread safety.

### 3.5. Composition Over Inheritance

- Favor composing reusable widgets and components (e.g., `ManagedTableView`) rather than relying on deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Leads to more maintainable, testable, and reusable code.

---

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns & Best Practices

### 4.1. Configuration Management

- Use a configuration module (e.g., Pydantic settings) to load and validate settings from environment variables or `.env` files.
- Avoid hard-coding configuration in the codebase.

### 4.2. Database Schema & Migrations

- Define all schema changes via migration scripts (e.g., Alembic).
- Use a single source of truth for schema (e.g., `schema.sql`).
- Use strict naming conventions for constraints and indexes.

### 4.3. Error and Exception Handling

- Use the `Result` pattern for business logic errors.
- Use exceptions for truly unexpected or fatal errors.
- Ensure all error messages are user-friendly and actionable when surfaced to the UI.

### 4.4. Code Quality & Tooling

- Enforce formatting (Black), linting (Ruff), and static typing (MyPy) project-wide.
- Integrate automated tests (pytest) into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Maintain high code coverage and require tests for new features and bugfixes.

### 4.5. Documentation & Readability

- Every module, class, and method should have clear docstrings explaining its purpose and usage.
- Maintain up-to-date architecture and codebase documentation (e.g., an Architecture Document, README).

## 5. Sample Project Structure

A standard, layered project folder structure should be used:

```
project-root/
│
├── app/
│   ├── core/                # DI container, async bridge, config, exceptions, result pattern
│   ├── business_logic/
│   │   ├── managers/
│   │   └── dto/
│   ├── services/
│   ├── models/
│   └── ui/
│       ├── dialogs/
│       ├── views/
│       └── widgets/
│
├── migrations/
├── scripts/
├── tests/
│   ├── conftest.py
│   ├── factories.py
│   └── unit/
│
├── pyproject.toml
├── docker-compose.dev.yml
├── .env.example
└── README.md
```

---

## 6. Testing Strategy

- Use `pytest` as the test runner.
- Isolate test database using in-memory SQLite or containerized PostgreSQL.
- Use fixtures to provide transactional test isolation (`conftest.py`).
- Cover business logic and service layers with unit tests; expand to UI tests using frameworks like `pytest-qt` as needed.
- Ensure all new code is accompanied by appropriate tests.

---

## 7. Recommendations for Future Enhancement

- Centralize generic logic (e.g., table models, error dialogs) for reuse.
- Expand automated test coverage to UI and integration points.
- Continuously review and refactor code to remove redundant or obsolete files.
- Use debouncing, caching, and async patterns for optimal UI performance.
- Maintain a living architecture document to ensure continued alignment.
