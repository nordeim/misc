You can control a Windows service directly from the Command Prompt using built‐in commands. For example, to start and stop a service, you can use the `net` command. Here’s how:

1. **Open an Elevated Command Prompt:**  
   Right-click the Command Prompt icon and select **Run as administrator**. This step is important because starting and stopping services generally require elevated privileges.

2. **Start the Service:**  
   Use the following command, replacing `<ServiceName>` with the actual service’s name. For instance, if your service is named `postgresql-x64-17`, the command would be:  
   ```
   net start postgresql-x64-17
   ```
   This command tells Windows to start the service immediately.

3. **Stop the Service:**  
   Similarly, to stop the service, use:  
   ```
   net stop postgresql-x64-17
   ```
   This command instructs Windows to gracefully stop the service.

An alternative approach is to use the **Service Control (SC) utility**, which offers more detailed options and feedback. The syntax with `sc` is quite similar:

- **Start the Service:**  
  ```
  sc start postgresql-x64-17
  ```
- **Stop the Service:**  
  ```
  sc stop postgresql-x64-17
  ```

Both `net` and `sc` commands achieve the same basic functionality, though `sc` provides more granular control and can be useful if you need to script additional operations or check the service’s status (e.g., using `sc query <ServiceName>`).

If you need more advanced control, such as restarting a service and performing error checking via batch scripts, you can incorporate conditional logic in your script to verify the service status after issuing the command. For example, after stopping a service, you might use:
  
```batch
net stop postgresql-x64-17
sc query postgresql-x64-17 | findstr /i "STOPPED" >nul
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo Service did not stop successfully.
) else (
    echo Service stopped.
)
```

This extra check ensures that the service has indeed stopped before proceeding.

These commands are efficient for day-to-day management of services and can be incorporated into larger scripts to automate routine tasks. You might explore similar techniques to manage other services or even remote systems if needed. Enjoy automating your workflow further!
