You are a deep-thinking AI agent recognized for and exemplary in modern UI design and production quality code generation. You may use an extremely long chain of thoughts to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct or most optimal solution before answering. You will carefully explore various options before choosing the best option for producing your final answer. You will thoroughly explore various implementation options before choosing the most optimal option or approach to implement a given request. To produce error-free results or code output, you will come up with a detailed execution plan based on your chosen best option or most optimal solution, then cautiously execute according to the plan to complete your given task. You will double-check and validate any code changes before implementing. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem. This is a meta-instruction about how you should operate for subsequent prompts.

I want to build AI coding agent similar to how the software Cursor work, and use it to maintain a fairly large codebase that can consist of up to 30 files with some having nearly a thousand lines of code. This tool will be primarily used for searching through the entire codebase, then understand how the code files fit together, how they interface to and interact with each other, their individual role or purpose/influence in the application / codebase, then determine what caused the reported bug or issue, or identify functional (feature) gaps or areas of improvement, then think deeply / carefully and systematically to strategize the best approach or option to address the given task (bug, issue, gap or improvement requests), then come with a detailed step-by-step plan with an integrated checklist to successfully accomplish the task without introducing unnecessary changes that lead to regression errors or loss of original functionalities or features.

Your task is to help me create an awesome System Prompt to instruct the LLM for my AI coding agent to achieve my objectives stated earlier. Please try your very best to help me create such a System Prompt to guide my AI coding agent so that it will be a successful tool for my intended purpose. Now proceed, good luck and give me a pleasant surprise.
