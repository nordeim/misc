# üöÄ ENHANCED CODENAVIGATOR DEVELOPMENT PLAN

## Executive Summary

Building a production-ready AI coding assistant requires a sophisticated architecture that balances performance, extensibility, and user experience. This enhanced plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for creating a tool that rivals Cursor, Claude Code, and Aider.

## üèóÔ∏è Enhanced Architecture Overview

### Core Design Principles
1. **Modular Architecture**: Plugin-based system for language support and AI providers
2. **Performance First**: Incremental analysis, caching, and async operations
3. **Context Awareness**: Multi-level context management (file, project, session)
4. **Safety & Reliability**: Comprehensive testing, rollback mechanisms, and validation
5. **Developer Experience**: Rich CLI interface, clear feedback, and intuitive workflows

### Technology Stack (Enhanced)

```yaml
Core Framework:
  Language: Python 3.11+
  CLI: Typer + Rich (enhanced terminal UI)
  Async: asyncio + aiofiles
  
Code Analysis:
  Primary: Tree-sitter (universal parsing)
  Language-Specific: 
    - Python: ast + rope
    - JavaScript/TypeScript: typescript compiler API
    - Java: JavaParser
    - C/C++: libclang
  
AI Integration:
  Primary: Anthropic Claude API
  Fallback: OpenAI GPT-4
  Local: Ollama support for offline usage
  
Data & State:
  Database: SQLite + SQLAlchemy
  Caching: Redis (optional)
  Configuration: Pydantic + YAML
  
Development:
  Testing: pytest + hypothesis (property-based testing)
  Linting: ruff + mypy
  Documentation: mkdocs + material theme
  CI/CD: GitHub Actions
```

## üìã Detailed Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Project Setup & Tooling
```bash
# Development environment setup
pyproject.toml configuration:
  - Dependencies with version pinning
  - Development dependencies (testing, linting, docs)
  - Build system configuration
  - Entry points for CLI
