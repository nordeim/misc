## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Claude API key
- Git (optional, for version control integration)

### Install via pip

```bash
pip install code-navigator
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-navigator.git
cd code-navigator
poetry install  # or pip install -e .
```

### Set up your API key

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Or add it to your configuration file:

```bash
codenav config set ai.api_key your_api_key_here
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Initialize your project

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Initialize CodeNavigator
codenav init
```

### Interactive Mode

The easiest way to get started is with interactive mode:

```bash
codenav interactive
```

This launches a user-friendly CLI interface where you can explore all of CodeNavigator's capabilities.

### Command-Line Workflows

For direct access to specific workflows:

```bash
# Analyze code to understand how it works
codenav analyze "How does the authentication system work?"

# Fix a bug
codenav fix "Users can't reset their password when using special characters"

# Add a new feature
codenav add "Implement dark mode toggle in the user settings page"

# Search the codebase
codenav search "authentication"

# Visualize dependencies
codenav visualize auth_controller.py
```

## üîÑ How It Works

CodeNavigator follows a systematic approach to understanding and transforming your code:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZuDCr4t.png" alt="CodeNavigator Workflow" width="800"/>
</div>

### 1. Project Onboarding & Indexing üìã

When first encountering your codebase, CodeNavigator:

- Parses your directory structure and understands file relationships
- Identifies key modules, classes, interfaces, and functions
- Maps imports, dependencies, and inheritance hierarchies
- Recognizes architectural patterns and design principles in use

### 2. Task Intake & Diagnostic Process üîç

When you assign a task, CodeNavigator:

- Ensures complete understanding of the requirements
- Asks targeted questions about unclear aspects
- For bugs: traces execution paths to identify failure points
- For features: identifies affected components and integration points
- Generates specific hypotheses explaining issues or guiding implementation

### 3. Solution Architecture & Analysis üìê

Before making changes, CodeNavigator:

- Develops multiple implementation approaches
- Evaluates each approach against criteria like:
  - Alignment with existing architecture
  - Minimal surface area of changes
  - Performance characteristics
  - Backward compatibility
  - Long-term maintainability
- Presents the preferred approach with clear rationale

### 4. Implementation Planning & Execution üõ†Ô∏è

When implementing changes, CodeNavigator:

- Breaks down the solution into sequential, atomic steps
- Creates a file-specific change plan with exact modifications
- Follows a comprehensive checklist to ensure quality
- Makes precise changes with minimal disruption to existing code

### 5. Testing & Validation üß™

After implementation, CodeNavigator:

- Designs tests for all modified functionality
- Includes both positive and negative test cases
- Verifies that changes don't break existing functionality
- Provides specific validation steps for manual testing

## üåä Workflows

### Code Analysis

Get deep insights into how your code works:

```bash
codenav analyze "How does the payment processing pipeline work?"
```

CodeNavigator will:
1. Identify relevant files in your codebase
2. Analyze how they work together
3. Generate a comprehensive explanation with diagrams
4. Allow you to ask follow-up questions

### Bug Fixing

Fix bugs with surgical precision:

```bash
codenav fix "Payment processing fails for international transactions"
```

CodeNavigator will:
1. Diagnose the root cause of the bug
2. Generate multiple fix approaches
3. Implement the optimal solution
4. Verify the fix works correctly

### Feature Addition

Add new features that integrate seamlessly:

```bash
codenav add "Add support for cryptocurrency payments"
```

CodeNavigator will:
1. Plan the feature implementation
2. Identify all affected components
3. Make the necessary changes
4. Add tests to verify functionality
