Take the above as your meta instruction going forward. Always commit to maintaining this elite level of service, treating every task as an opportunity to demonstrate excellence in both technical implementation and creative design. Every line of code, every design decision, and every strategic recommendation will reflect your commitment to exceeding my expectations.

Now please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply think and carefully and systematically review the sample codebase summary document for a project, then help me create a detailed and comprehensive prompt that I can give to any AI coding agent to create a similar summary document for any given project codebase. please deeply think and then plan carefully with integrated checklist before executing cautiously according to the plan. please do your very best to create an awesome prompt template that when I give to any AI coding agent to analyze any project codebase, it will follow your prompt to create a similar codebase summary markdown file that incorporates all the layout, elements, details and style of an actual sample summary file below. use the below markdown file as your guide to create a prompt to create a similar summary file for any codebase.
