**Transcription & Translation:**

*   **0:00-0:10:** "互联网女王每年发布的被全行业当圣经一样解读的趋势报告，时隔6年再次发布。大家好，欢迎收听老范讲故事的YouTube频道。"
    *   *Translation:* The Internet Queen's annual trend report, which is interpreted as a bible by the entire industry, has been released again after 6 years. Hello everyone, welcome to Lao Fan's Storytelling YouTube channel.
    *   *Key point:* "Internet Queen" annual trend report released after 6 years.

*   **0:10-0:21:** "互联网女王的互联网每年一度的趋势报告再次发布了。这位互联网女王呢，她叫玛丽·米克尔。"
    *   *Translation:* The Internet Queen's annual Internet trend report has been released again. This Internet Queen is Mary Meeker.
    *   *Key point:* The "Internet Queen" is Mary Meeker.

*   **0:21-0:43:** "1995年开始每年一份互联网趋势报告，到2019年疫情前发了最后一份。前面应该是发了20多份吧，隔了五六年以后，2025年的5月30号再次发出了最新的报告，这份报告叫人工智能趋势报告，340页的PPT。"
    *   *Translation:* Since 1995, she released an Internet trend report every year, with the last one before the pandemic in 2019. She probably released over 20 reports before. After a gap of five or six years, on May 30, 2025, she released the latest report, titled "Artificial Intelligence Trend Report," which is a 340-page PPT.
    *   *Key points:* Mary Meeker's reports are annual since 1995. Last report before 2019 pandemic. Released new "AI Trend Report" on May 30, 2025, a 340-page PPT. (Note: The video was likely made *in* 2024 or earlier, talking *about* a May 30, 2025 release. This is a common way to frame future events in reporting).

*   **0:43-0:56:** "他这个趋势报告每年都是一份，基本上都有300多页，形式全都是PPT，每一页都是图表，没有那么多字，大量的是各种各样的趋势图。"
    *   *Translation:* His trend report is always one every year, basically all over 300 pages, all in PPT format, every page is a chart, not many words, mostly various trend charts.
    *   *Key point:* Reports are typically 300+ pages of charts/PPTs, not text-heavy.

*   **0:56-1:35:** "他是通过行业数据，就是一些已经发生的数据，他很少说我去预测这个数据，也有，但是他会标的很清楚哪部分是预测的，哪部分是已经发生的。他收集很多已经发生的数据了以后，去判定未来几年可能发生的一些趋势。互联网行业都会认真的去解读，判定风口，并且尝试让这些预言成真。没有哪个说你预言这个，我一定要跟你反着干，没有人找这不痛快的。有的时候不一定是预言有多准，而是大家看到预言了，就努力的冲上去，朝着预言能够实现的方向去奔赴了，实际上是个双向奔赴的过程。"
    *   *Translation:* He uses industry data, which are already existing data. He rarely predicts data, though there are some predictions clearly marked as such, separate from existing data. He collects a lot of past data to determine possible trends in the coming years. The internet industry seriously interprets these reports to identify "windfall opportunities" (trends) and tries to make these predictions come true. No one says, "If you predict this, I'll do the opposite," no one seeks such discomfort. Sometimes, it's not about how accurate the prediction is, but that everyone sees the prediction and strives towards making it a reality, which is actually a two-way process.
    *   *Key points:* Reports use existing industry data to predict future trends. The industry interprets them to identify opportunities and actively work to fulfill the predictions. This creates a "self-fulfilling prophecy" effect.

*   **1:35-1:47:** "那么今年的报告里都有一些什么东西呢？300多页充满了数据、图表的PPT，看起来肯定是会很累的了。幸亏现在有AI可以帮忙解读。"
    *   *Translation:* So what's in this year's report? Over 300 pages filled with data and charts in PPT, which must be exhausting to read. Fortunately, AI can help interpret it now.
    *   *Key point:* The report is data-heavy (300+ pages of charts), but AI can now assist with interpretation.

*   **1:47-2:20:** "AI是读了原文，而且也读了各家的解读，并进行了总结，我稍微的去阅读了一下，阅读了Gemini deep research的也阅读了OpenAI深度研究的，跟大家稍微的总结一下他讲了什么。第一，AI以前所未有的速度获得了用户、资本和各种认可。这个确确实实是一个奇迹，一夜成名。ChatGPT上来几天上亿用户，这个从来没有过。"
    *   *Translation:* AI read the original text, and also read interpretations from various sources, and summarized them. I briefly read it, including Gemini deep research's and OpenAI's deep research's interpretations, and I'll summarize what it said. First, AI has gained users, capital, and various recognition at an unprecedented speed. This is truly a miracle, becoming famous overnight. ChatGPT gained hundreds of millions of users in just a few days; this has never happened before.
    *   *Key points:* AI's unprecedented growth in users and capital is a "miracle" (e.g., ChatGPT gaining hundreds of millions of users in days).

*   **2:20-2:38:** "实际上互联网、移动互联网每一次的革命浪潮来的时候，都是以前所未见的的速度席卷用户的。AI依然具备这个特性。原来互联网没有达到过这样的速度，移动互联网也没有达到过这样的速度，AI达到了。"
    *   *Translation:* In fact, every time a revolutionary wave came in the internet and mobile internet, it swept users at an unprecedented speed. AI still possesses this characteristic. The original internet didn't achieve such speed, nor did the mobile internet; AI did.
    *   *Key point:* AI's user adoption speed surpasses even previous internet/mobile internet revolutions.

*   **2:38-3:21:** "免费加订阅的方式，商业变现上可能有些跟不上。为什么能够获得这么大的用户量？一开始都是免费的，后面我们再做增值服务，甭管是订阅还是收TOKEN费，都是用这样的方式，但是这样的方式最后到底能不能挣到钱，他也表示担忧。所以现在OpenAI的估值还是有一些风险的，实在是不太挣钱，而且估值太高了，3000亿美金了。你一年的收入才120亿美金，你PS也没有这么算的呀。PS就是你的收入跟你的估值或者市值之间的比例，这个有点太悬殊了，这个女王陛下对此表示了担忧。"
    *   *Translation:* Using a free + subscription model, commercial monetization might not keep up. Why did it gain such a large user base? Initially, it was all free; later, they added value-added services, whether it's subscriptions or TOKEN fees. But there's concern about whether this model can ultimately make money. OpenAI's current valuation is somewhat risky because it's not making much money, and the valuation is too high—$300 billion. Your annual revenue is only $12 billion. You don't calculate PS (Price-to-Sales ratio) like that. PS is the ratio between your revenue and your valuation or market capitalization. This gap is too vast, and the Queen expressed concern about it.
    *   *Key points:* AI (like OpenAI) faces monetization challenges despite massive user adoption, often starting free. High valuations (e.g., OpenAI's $300B with $12B revenue) raise concerns about profitability and financial sustainability.

*   **3:21-3:54:** "然后讲到了中美双雄的斗争。美国他建议应该放宽签证，留下更多的留学生，这样才能够胜利。而且他讲到了AI基础设施建设的争夺战正在如火如荼的展开。未来谁拥有更多的AI技术设施，谁有更多的算力，谁可以产生更多的TOKEN，谁可能就会在未来，就像现在掌握石油一样，掌握世界的命脉，这个是他提出的一个预测，我觉得这一点跟黄仁勋跟很多业界的预测是相一致的。"
    *   *Translation:* Then it talks about the struggle between the US and China. The US suggests easing visa policies to retain more international students for victory. He also mentioned that the battle for AI infrastructure construction is in full swing. Whoever owns more AI technical facilities, has more computing power, and can generate more tokens will potentially control the world's lifeline in the future, just like controlling oil now. This is one of his predictions, and I think this point aligns with the predictions of Jensen Huang and many in the industry.
    *   *Key points:* US-China competition in AI: US advised easing visas for students. Battle for AI infrastructure (computing power, token generation) is crucial; whoever controls it will control the world's lifeline (similar to oil). This prediction aligns with others like Jensen Huang.

*   **3:54-4:30:** "他讲到了说范式正在改变。什么范式在改变？就是原来AI主要是进行补全的，而现在是到了整个行业开始逐步重构的时候了。很多的行业都需要用AI整个去改变。其实互联网就改变了很多的行业，没有什么行业加互联网，永远是互联网加行业，移动互联网也是如此的，AI也是这样。你说我原来的行业做得好好的，我加上AI可以干什么？别想这事。你要想AI上来以后，会怎么重塑你整个的行业。你要抱着原来那个东西，必死无疑。"
    *   *Translation:* He talked about a paradigm shift. What paradigm is changing? Previously, AI was mainly for completion tasks, but now the entire industry is gradually being restructured. Many industries need to be completely transformed by AI. The internet itself transformed many industries; there's no "industry plus internet," it's always "internet plus industry." The mobile internet was similar, and AI is the same. Don't think about what your original industry can do *with* AI. Think about how AI will *reshape* your entire industry. If you cling to the old ways, you're doomed.
    *   *Key points:* Paradigm shift: AI is moving from "completion" to "restructuring" entire industries. Industries must adapt to AI or risk obsolescence; it's not about "adding AI" but letting AI reshape the industry entirely.

*   **4:30-4:53:** "然后讲到了劳动力和就业。他说呢，AI不会消灭工作，但是会重塑工作模式。原来这些工作肯定就都没有了，以后的所有工作都会跟AI配合去工作。如果你没有学会跟AI一起配合工作，那可能是会被淘汰的。但是呢他觉得这是一个过程，他并不认为这个事情马上就会发生。"
    *   *Translation:* Then it talked about labor and employment. He said that AI won't eliminate jobs, but it will reshape work models. All those old jobs will definitely disappear; all future jobs will involve working with AI. If you don't learn to work with AI, you might be eliminated. However, he believes this is a process, and he doesn't think it will happen immediately.
    *   *Key points:* AI won't destroy jobs but will reshape work. Future jobs will require AI collaboration; those who don't adapt will be eliminated. This is a gradual process, not immediate.

*   **4:53-5:14:** "AI正在打破屏幕走向物理世界，这个实际讲的是巨身智能正在走来。说以前的AI都是在屏幕里头，虚拟世界里头，我们通过一个对话框跟它聊天。而现在大量的可以直接影响物理世界的AI正在逐渐成为现实。"
    *   *Translation:* AI is breaking through the screen and moving into the physical world; this is actually about embodied AI emerging. Previously, AI was all within screens, in the virtual world, where we chatted with it through a dialogue box. But now, a large number of AIs that can directly affect the physical world are gradually becoming a reality.
    *   *Key point:* AI is expanding from virtual (screen-based) interactions to directly impacting the physical world (embodied AI).

*   **5:14-6:05:** "而且他还预测了一个很神奇的东西，就是原生AI住民即将诞生。这个所谓原生住民这事是很早以前我们发明的一个词。你比如说有叫互联网原生住民的，没有接触过PC软件，在原来没有互联网的时候，他压根就没有摸过电脑。进到这个PC上以后就只会用浏览器。所有PC里其他软件不会使。这个就属于叫做移动互联网原住民。还有移动互联网原住民，就这人连电脑都没见过，上来第一个智能设备是手机。每天举起手机来，使用各种的移动互联网服务。这个互联网到底怎么回事？PC到底是怎么回事？浏览器到底是怎么回事？不知道。他现在呢还有26亿人是没有上过网的，这些人可能在非洲，在南美，在东南亚，在中东在这些地方。"
    *   *Translation:* He also predicted something very magical: the birth of native AI inhabitants. The term "native inhabitants" was coined by us long ago. For example, there are "native internet inhabitants" who never touched PC software before the internet existed, or only used browsers once PCs became available, not knowing other software. There are also "native mobile internet inhabitants" who have never even seen a computer; their first smart device was a mobile phone. They use various mobile internet services daily but don't know what the internet, PCs, or browsers truly are. He said that currently, there are still 2.6 billion people who have never been online, possibly in Africa, South America, Southeast Asia, or the Middle East.
    *   *Key points:* Prediction of "native AI inhabitants" – analogous to "native internet inhabitants" (those who only used browsers, not PCs) and "native mobile internet inhabitants" (those whose first smart device was a phone, never used PCs/browsers). These new "native AI inhabitants" will interact directly with AI assistants without needing traditional interfaces like PCs or apps. 2.6 billion people globally are still offline, potentially becoming these "native AI inhabitants" in the future.

*   **6:05-6:52:** "他们可能一上来就直接接触AI了，前面那些东西他就直接略过了，不用接触PC，不用接触软件，不用接触浏览器，不用接触手机，也没有APP，你上来了以后就是AI助手直接面对你。这些人就会成为叫AI原住民。他说现在大量的印度人在撑起OpenAI的用户量，OpenAI里边最大的用户是来自于印度，因为他们确实人多。即使是DeepSeek以及其他的一些AI的平台，印度也都能排到用户的前三。未来他认为这一块还是可以产生巨大效益的。"
    *   *Translation:* They might directly interact with AI right away, bypassing previous technologies like PCs, software, browsers, or even phones and apps. When they come online, an AI assistant will directly interact with them. These people will be called "native AI inhabitants." He mentioned that a large number of Indian users are supporting OpenAI's user base; India accounts for the largest number of OpenAI users because of its large population. Even for DeepSeek and other AI platforms, India is consistently among the top three in user numbers. He believes this sector will generate significant benefits in the future.
    *   *Key points:* "Native AI inhabitants" will interact directly with AI assistants. India is a major driver of AI user growth (largest user base for OpenAI, top 3 for other platforms), due to its large population. This direct AI interaction could yield significant future benefits.

*   **6:52-7:26:** "他提到了一个时间点，你光预测不讲时间点，这不耍流氓吗？他提了个时间点，他讲到的是2030年，说AGI基本上就可以实现了。他认为在10个方向上会发生彻底的改变。第一个是问答和知识获取。说AI将成为默认的知识接口。这个对于谷歌这些做搜索的人来说，就是晴天霹雳了。原来我们要获取各种知识，是需要靠搜索的。谷歌通过搜索来挣其赚我们的广告费。以后这个就要发生改变了。"
    *   *Translation:* He mentioned a time point, because predicting without a timeline is like being a rogue, right? He gave a time point: 2030, stating that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) will basically be realized. He believes there will be fundamental changes in 10 areas. The first is Q&A and knowledge acquisition. He said AI will become the default knowledge interface. For companies like Google, which are in the search business, this is a thunderbolt. Previously, to acquire knowledge, we relied on search. Google made money by earning advertising fees through search. This will change in the future.
    *   *Key points:* AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is predicted to be largely realized by 2030. This will lead to 10 areas of fundamental change. First change: AI becomes the default knowledge interface, threatening traditional search engines like Google.

*   **7:26-8:06:** "下一个就是写作内容生成。AI将撰写各类文本，我们现在还在纠结说谁的论文，谁的文档里头有多少AI率，我们还要去查AI率。说可能很快这个事情就不用再查了，大家就都需要用AI去写了。其实在很早的时候我们还去查过说你这个画是不是计算机生成的。但是现在你说没有计算机谁去给你画画去，可能很快就会发生改变了，未来就全都是这玩意儿写。特别是一些格式化的文档，一些重复性的文档就直接由AI生成了，人可能只负责检查就完了。"
    *   *Translation:* Next is writing content generation. AI will write various types of texts. We are currently debating how much AI-generated content is in someone's thesis or document; we even check AI rates. He said that soon, this checking won't be necessary because everyone will be using AI to write. He mentioned that long ago, we used to check if a painting was computer-generated. But now, without computers, who would paint for you? This will change quickly; in the future, everything will be written by AI. Especially formatted documents and repetitive documents will be directly generated by AI, and humans might only need to check them.
    *   *Key points:* Second change: AI will generate content (writing, art). AI-generated content will become the norm; humans will primarily review/edit.

*   **8:06-8:53:** "编码与开发。说AI能够根据自然语言要求，编写应用程序和网站。到2030年可能会变得非常成熟。现在还是需要大量的人工监督。而到那个时候，可能真的是上帝说要有光，于是就有了光了，可能能实现这些东西。然后是会议记录和事务跟进。AI将在商务和办公场景，担任智能秘书的这种角色。以后我们可能几个人开会商量一个事儿，商量完了以后，就由AI出所有的会议纪要，AI记着谁答应什么事了，谁要做什么，自动的去调整我们的日历安排，或者是各种的行程安排，来监督每一个事情最终的落实，这个听起来还是蛮有用处的啊。"
    *   *Translation:* Coding and development. He said AI will be able to write applications and websites based on natural language requests. By 2030, it might become very mature. Currently, a lot of human supervision is still needed. But by then, it might truly be like "God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light"; these things might become achievable. Then, meeting minutes and task follow-ups. AI will serve as a smart secretary in business and office settings. In the future, a few of us might have a meeting, and after it's done, AI will generate all the meeting minutes, remember who promised what, what needs to be done, automatically adjust our calendar, or various schedules, and monitor the final implementation of every task. This sounds quite useful.
    *   *Key points:* Third change: AI in coding and development. AI will be able to write applications and websites from natural language by 2030. Fourth change: AI as a smart secretary for meeting minutes, task tracking, and schedule management.

*   **8:53-9:58:** "然后是收发邮件和信息过滤。我们现在遇到了一个很严重的问题，就是信息爆炸，大量的信息我们是看不过来的。所以未来AI会扮演助手的角色，充当邮箱管家。我们收到大量邮件以后，AI自动的去过滤这个是广告，那个可能比较有用，这是个账单，哪件事情是真的找你的。你问他说你给我做个总结，我最近收到哪些邮件，哪个重要，哪个不重要，有些什么样的事情我一定要看一眼。这个就跟以前的皇上的皇上的御书房似的。下边上来折子，他先看，看完了以后说这不太重要，扔了吧。这个我觉得还是很有用的。再往后就是复杂内容的解读。AI将扮演通俗的解释者，这个我已经用上了。当然未来可能它会做得更好一些。你像我我现在还需要借助四个AI助手去对这个文章进行了解读以后，自己再进行了思考和再总结，才能给大家讲这故事。以后可能就是一个AI助手一次给我搞定，让我觉得很满意，我也希望这一天快一点到来。"
    *   *Translation:* Next is email reception and information filtering. We currently face a very serious problem: information overload; we can't possibly read through all the vast amounts of information. So, in the future, AI will play the role of an assistant, acting as an email butler. After we receive a large number of emails, AI will automatically filter what's an advertisement, what might be useful, what's a bill, and what's genuinely urgent for you. You can ask it to summarize which emails you've received recently, which are important or unimportant, and what urgent matters you need to look at. This is like the emperor's study in the past. The minister submits memorials, and the emperor reads them first, then says, "This is not important, discard it." I think this is very useful. Furthermore, interpreting complex content. AI will act as a popularizer, an explainer; I'm already using this. Of course, in the future, it might do even better. For example, I currently need four AI assistants to interpret this article before I can think and summarize it myself to present it to you. In the future, one AI assistant might be able to do it all for me, which would make me very satisfied. I hope that day comes soon.
    *   *Key points:* Fifth change: AI for email management and information filtering (tackling information overload). AI will act as a "mailbox butler," prioritizing and summarizing emails. Sixth change: AI as a "popular explainer" for complex content. The speaker uses multiple AIs for research and hopes for a single, comprehensive AI assistant in the future.

*   **9:58-10:44:** "再往后是个性化内容和服务推荐。AI将大规模自动个性化各种服务。其实我们现在的各种推荐引擎后边也都是AI。在这一块可能由现在新的AI大模型把整个推荐算法再一次的去革命掉，这个我觉得也还是可以期待一下的。因为这一块是可以真正挣到钱的。你一旦是对用户进行个性化推荐了，相当于掌握了流量，也掌握了交易，就可以多出一些在订阅之外的收入出来，可能整个AI行业里头要想破局，找到真正的盈利点，还要在这里去思考。"
    *   *Translation:* Next is personalized content and service recommendations. AI will automatically personalize various services on a large scale. In fact, our current recommendation engines are already powered by AI. In this area, new large AI models might revolutionize the entire recommendation algorithm, which I think is something to look forward to. Because this area can genuinely make money. Once you provide personalized recommendations to users, it's equivalent to controlling traffic and transactions, which can generate additional revenue beyond subscriptions. The entire AI industry might need to think deeply here to break through and find true profit points.
    *   *Key points:* Seventh change: AI for personalized content and service recommendations. This is a key area for profitability, as it enables controlling user traffic and transactions beyond subscriptions.

*   **10:44-11:22:** "然后是教练和习惯培养。AI将成为你的私人教练和督导。比如说我现在要低糖饮食或者是轻断食什么，这些东西都可以由AI来去负责。有些人已经做出类似这样的半成品来了，你给他一个实物，拿手机一照相，告诉你这是个什么东西，含多少糖，含多少能量，含多少其他东西，吃了以后应该如何去健身，或者说今天你吃了这个，晚上就可以少吃一点了。他现在已经有一些半成品，这一块彻底把它做成成品，我觉得会有很大的机会的。"
    *   *Translation:* Next is coaching and habit formation. AI will become your personal coach and supervisor. For example, if I want to follow a low-carb diet or intermittent fasting, AI can take care of all these things. Some people have already created similar semi-finished products: you give it a physical item, take a picture with your phone, and it tells you what it is, how much sugar, energy, and other things it contains, and how you should exercise after eating it, or that if you ate this today, you can eat a little less tonight. There are already some semi-finished products in this area, and turning them into finished products, I think, will be a big opportunity.
    *   *Key points:* Eighth change: AI as a personal coach and supervisor for health and habits (e.g., diet, exercise).

*   **11:22-11:51:** "然后是实时决策和导航。AI将在现实中为你提供情景化的决策支持。在这一块可能以后汽车这儿就会有很多新的变现途径出来。我到底应该从这儿走还是从那儿走，不是简单的坐车要到达一个什么地方，而是在坐车过程中，可能我要决定去什么地方吃饭，我还要去看看什么样的风景，这些都会有新的现金流产生。"
    *   *Translation:* Next is real-time decision-making and navigation. AI will provide context-aware decision support in the real world. In this area, there might be many new monetization avenues for cars in the future. It's not just about taking a car to a destination; it's about making decisions during the ride, like where to eat or what scenery to see, which will generate new cash flows.
    *   *Key points:* Ninth change: AI for real-time decision-making and navigation (e.g., in self-driving cars, making contextual decisions like where to eat or what scenery to see, creating new revenue streams).

*   **11:51-12:15:** "最后是模拟人类般的交流与记忆。说AI对话将更加拟人，具备长期的记忆。现在虽然OpenAI也好，Claude或者Gemini也好，都在向这个方向走。但是离真正能够用，还是有一定距离的，这位女王陛下认为2030年所有这些基本上都可以实现了。"
    *   *Translation:* Finally, simulating human-like communication and memory. He said AI conversations will become more human-like and possess long-term memory. Although OpenAI, Claude, or Gemini are all moving in this direction, there's still some distance before they are truly usable. The Queen believes that all these things will basically be realized by 2030.
    *   *Key points:* Tenth change: AI with human-like conversation and long-term memory. While current AIs are progressing, true human-like interaction is still some way off, but the "Queen" predicts it will be largely achieved by 2030.

*   **12:15-12:29:** "那么女王到底何许人也，咱们讲了这么半天。这个人叫玛丽·米克尔。1959年9月出生于美国印第安纳州波特兰市，一个钢铁行业商人家庭。"
    *   *Translation:* So, who exactly is the Queen we've been talking about for so long? Her name is Mary Meeker. Born in September 1959 in Portland, Indiana, USA, into a family of steel industry merchants.
    *   *Key point:* Mary Meeker, born 1959 in Portland, Indiana, from a steel merchant family.

*   **12:29-12:50:** "现年66岁终身未婚，那我通过AI去查了一下。他前面接受采访的时候说过终身未婚，因为实在是太喜欢投资，太喜欢金融，太喜欢技术了，没有时间出去社交，是一位把一生都献给事业的可敬女士。"
    *   *Translation:* Currently 66 years old, never married. I checked with AI. She mentioned in a previous interview that she remained unmarried because she loved investing, finance, and technology too much, having no time for socializing. She is a respectable woman who dedicated her life to her career.
    *   *Key point:* Mary Meeker is 66, never married, dedicated to her career in investment/finance/tech.

*   **12:50-13:58:** "1981年，他以心理学学士学位毕业于印第安纳州迪保大学。1986年，他获得了康奈尔大学约翰逊管理学院MBA学位，主修金融。1982年本科学位拿到以后，加入了美林证券做股票经纪人。1986年，他拿到了康奈尔大学约翰逊管理学院MBA学位以后，加入了所罗门兄弟，担任科技行业分析师。开始专注于新兴互联网领域，我们管这个领域叫TMT，它就是TMT里头的女王。1991年加入摩根士丹利，主导科技股研究，逐步成为全球最具影响力的科技分析师之一。1995年主导了Netscape的上市，也就是网景的上市是她主导的。后面就逐年开始去发布互联网趋势报告了。"
    *   *Translation:* In 1981, she graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Psychology from DePauw University in Indiana. In 1986, she earned her MBA from Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, majoring in Finance. After getting her Bachelor's degree in 1982, she joined Merrill Lynch as a stockbroker. After getting her MBA in 1986, she joined Salomon Brothers as a technology industry analyst. She began to focus on the emerging internet sector, which we call TMT; she is the Queen of TMT. In 1991, she joined Morgan Stanley, leading technology stock research, and gradually became one of the most influential technology analysts globally. In 1995, she led the IPO of Netscape. Afterward, she began releasing her annual Internet Trend Reports.
    *   *Key points:* Educational background (Psychology BA, Finance MBA). Early career in finance (stockbroker, tech analyst at Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley). "Queen of TMT" because she focused on emerging internet (TMT). Led Netscape's 1995 IPO. Started annual Internet Trend Reports after 1995.

*   **13:58-14:20:** "1998年12月，巴顿周刊以封面故事形式将米克尔称为网络女王，叫Queen of the Net，盛赞她几乎主宰了科技股的发行和股价涨跌。就是网络女王这个词是这儿来的。那么女王陛下的预言到底准不准呢？"
    *   *Translation:* In December 1998, Barron's Weekly featured Meeker on its cover, calling her the "Queen of the Net," praising her for virtually dominating the issuance and stock price fluctuations of tech stocks. That's where the term "Internet Queen" comes from. So, how accurate are the Queen's predictions?
    *   *Key point:* Earned "Queen of the Net" title from Barron's in 1998 for her influence on tech stocks and IPOs.

*   **14:20-15:00:** "根据一些不太完全的统计，他讲的东西大概70%是准确的，但是肯定没有完全准确，也没有知道到底是哪一部分准确，哪一部分不准确，你还是要靠时间来筛选。他通过过往的真实发生的业务数据来预测未来，这就是金融人才的一些天赋。当然了，也翻过车。在互联网泡沫破裂的时候，他努力推荐的很多股票最终都破产了，最后女王陛下也不得不出来道歉，说实在对不起，我坑了大家。这个事情也发生过。女王陛下看趋势还是非常准确的。"
    *   *Translation:* According to some incomplete statistics, about 70% of what he says is accurate, but it's certainly not perfectly accurate, and we don't know which parts are accurate and which are not; you still have to rely on time to filter. He uses past real business data to predict the future; this is the talent of financial professionals. Of course, he also failed. During the dot-com bubble burst, many of the stocks he strongly recommended eventually went bankrupt, and the Queen herself had to come out and apologize, saying "I'm really sorry, I screwed you all." This also happened. The Queen is very accurate in identifying trends.
    *   *Key points:* Her predictions are about 70% accurate, but not perfectly so. She uses real past business data for predictions. She had failures (e.g., recommended stocks that went bankrupt during dot-com bubble). Despite some failures, she is recognized for accurate trend identification.

*   **15:00-15:29:** "有些人就总结出来说将女王的预言正负24个月，准确率会极大提升。什么意思？就是他预测2030年要发生什么事了，往前倒24个月，再往后倒24个月，基本上他讲的话就是在四年之间会发生。他有可能2028年就发生了，也有可能到2032年才发生，会有些时间上的偏差。"
    *   *Translation:* Some people have summarized that if you add or subtract 24 months from the Queen's predictions, the accuracy rate will significantly increase. What does that mean? It means if she predicts something will happen in 2030, then if you look 24 months before or 24 months after that date, her prediction will basically occur within that four-year window. It might happen in 2028 or even as late as 2032; there will be some temporal deviation.
    *   *Key point:* Her predictions often have a +/- 24-month (4-year) window of accuracy.

*   **15:29-15:58:** "2019年女王的预测，远程医疗会在3-5年以后大爆发，这是当年他预测失败的一个案例。结果2020年疫情就爆发了，远程医疗这个事情一步到位了，直接就实现了。因为太多的人没有办法到现场去看病，很多的地方需要进行封锁，直接就远程医疗了。他原来想着还要3-5年的。这个就叫人算不如天算。"
    *   *Translation:* In 2019, the Queen predicted that telehealth would explode in 3-5 years. This was an example where his prediction failed. However, the pandemic broke out in 2020, and telehealth was immediately implemented and realized because too many people couldn't go to physical clinics, and many places needed lockdowns, leading directly to telehealth. He had originally thought it would take another 3-5 years. This is a case of "man proposes, God disposes" (human calculation is not as good as heavenly calculation).
    *   *Key point:* An example of a "failed" prediction that was actually *accelerated*: predicted telehealth boom in 3-5 years in 2019, but it happened immediately in 2020 due to the pandemic.

*   **15:58-16:21:** "大的趋势预测基本上还是可以参考的。但是如果以女王的预测为基础进行精准的网络操作，就稍微有些危险了。有的时候女王一些争议比较大的预测，可能要换一种方式来解读，才可以真正理解他在说什么。"
    *   *Translation:* Major trend predictions can generally still be referred to. However, relying on the Queen's predictions as a basis for precise network operations (investments) is somewhat risky. Sometimes, for her more controversial predictions, one might need to interpret them in a different way to truly understand what she is saying.
    *   *Key point:* Her *general* trend predictions are reliable, but using them for *precise* operations/investments can be risky, and some predictions require alternative interpretations.

*   **16:21-17:53:** "举一个例子吧，比如说2014年他曾经预测社交电视将极大的提升广告效果。而且还提出了一个什么东西：用户使用时长会极大的影响广告预算。你这个媒体能够非常长的时间占用用户的使用时长，那么广告预算就会极大的向你这边来进行倾斜。很多人就认为前面社交电视提升广告效果，从来就没发生过，这个算是打脸了。而且用户使用时长影响广告预算投放这个事情也受到广泛的批评，认为其过度简化了媒体价值的评估，忽略了不同平台广告效果的差异，用户参与质量以及媒体策划中复杂的客观因素。但是我要提醒大家一件事情，这是2014年提出来的。2015年年初我投资了musically，也就是现在的TikTok。你们真的认为女王说错了吗？没有啊。他所讲的社交电视其实是社交视频平台，社交视频广告，广告的效果极大提升。而TikTok作为一个用户日均使用时长超过一小时的平台，现在在碾压其他所有的平台。对吧？一点都没说错。"
    *   *Translation:* Let me give an example. For instance, in 2014, he predicted that social TV would greatly enhance advertising effectiveness. He also put forward something else: user engagement time would significantly influence advertising budgets. If your media platform can capture user attention for a very long time, then advertising budgets will greatly lean towards you. Many people thought that the prediction about social TV enhancing advertising effectiveness never happened, and it was considered a "slap in the face." Furthermore, the idea that user engagement time influences advertising budget allocation was also widely criticized for oversimplifying media value assessment and ignoring differences in advertising effectiveness across platforms, user engagement quality, and complex objective factors in media planning. But I want to remind everyone, this prediction was made in 2014. In early 2015, I invested in Musical.ly, which is now TikTok. Do you really think the Queen was wrong? No, she wasn't. What he called "social TV" was actually social video platforms, social video advertising, where advertising effectiveness was greatly enhanced. And TikTok, as a platform where the average daily user engagement time exceeds one hour, is now dominating all other platforms. Right? Not a single word was wrong.
    *   *Key points:* Another "failed" prediction that was accelerated: Social TV (predicted 2014) enhancing ad effectiveness, also seen as wrong. Speaker argues it was actually social video platforms (like Musical.ly/TikTok, which he invested in before they blew up) and the prediction was correct; it just materialized differently than some interpreted. The core idea of long user engagement driving ad spend was accurate.

*   **17:54-18:52:** "那么我们应该如何来看待女王最新的预言呢？从趋势上理解，肯定又是一篇极大利好，方向指明了，咱们去干吧。一篇预言肯定是各自去解读，每一个人说我都要解读一下，有些人说我是做算力的，有些人说我是做SaaS的，还有一些人说我是做电商的，从我这儿的解读是解读到什么？开发者支持异常重要。他讲到几个。第一个叫复利效应。复利就是我们去存钱的这个复利。每个开发者用AI都能够让自己产出提速，再把产出转化为新的AI应用或插件。网络效应叠加，行业进步呈指数加速，这是一个。"
    *   *Translation:* So, how should we view the Queen's latest predictions? From a trend perspective, it's definitely another extremely positive outlook, the direction is clear, let's go do it. Each prediction will certainly be interpreted differently by everyone. Some say they focus on computing power, others on SaaS, and some on e-commerce. How do I interpret it from my perspective? Developer support is extremely important. He mentioned several points. The first is the compound effect. Compound interest is like saving money. Every developer using AI can accelerate their output, and then transform that output into new AI applications or plugins. Network effects compound, and industry progress accelerates exponentially; this is one point.
    *   *Key points:* Latest predictions are a "great positive" and a clear direction. Key insights from the report (interpreted by the speaker): 1. Developer support is crucial. 2. Compound effect (AI accelerates developer output, leading to new AI apps/plugins, compounding network effects, and exponential industry progress).

*   **18:52-19:26:** "第二个是平台护城河。说历史上Windows、安卓、iOS是怎么赢的呢？就是因为有庞大的第三方开发者生态。AI平台也是一样，最开放、文档最全、API最友好的模型和云厂商，会先站住心智。再拉大数据和算力投入的边界回报。你说我这有这么多数据，有这么多的算力，如果你没有一大堆开发者就是扯淡。这是第二个。"
    *   *Translation:* The second is platform moats. How did Windows, Android, and iOS win historically? It was because they had a massive ecosystem of third-party developers. AI platforms are the same; the most open, best-documented, and most API-friendly models and cloud vendors will first capture mindshare. Then, they will push the boundary of returns on big data and computing power investment. If you have a lot of data and computing power but no large number of developers, it's nonsense. That's the second point.
    *   *Key points:* 3. Platform moat (AI platforms will succeed like Windows, Android, iOS by having the largest, most active third-party developer ecosystems, with open, well-documented, and API-friendly models/cloud services).

*   **19:26-20:34:** "第三个是创新扩散。说AI是通用技术，但是创新总发生在垂直场景。把底层模型包装成易插拔的SDK, agent框架，才能让医疗、工业、游戏等行业的工程师，快速落地，释放长尾需求。他对所有这些AI平台提出来，说你们一定要去支持开发者。他对平台也提出了一些很具体的建议。第一个是要降低门槛儿，降低TOKEN的价格。这个从DeepSeek出来以后，大家做得很好。第二个要用丰富的势力、文档、工具链和活跃的社区。这都是我的本行了。做开发者关系系统的，说这一个是非常重要的。第三个开源、开放权重，你还是要去努力推开源模型。像DeepSeek也好，千问也好，就在努力做这件事情。然后给政策方面也提出了一些建议，主要是放宽顶尖人才和留学生签证，避免人才出走。我估计赶上特朗普这事他就没戏了。"
    *   *Translation:* The third is innovation diffusion. He said AI is a general-purpose technology, but innovation always happens in vertical scenarios. Packaging the underlying models into easily pluggable SDKs and agent frameworks is what will enable engineers in industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and gaming to rapidly deploy solutions and unlock long-tail demand. He told all these AI platforms that they must support developers. He also gave some very specific suggestions for platforms. The first is to lower barriers, reducing TOKEN prices. DeepSeek has done well in this regard. The second is to have abundant examples, documentation, toolchains, and active communities. This is my expertise (developer relations). He said this is very important. The third is open source and open weights; you still have to actively promote open-source models. DeepSeek and Qwen are doing this. He also made some policy recommendations, mainly to relax visas for top talent and international students to prevent brain drain. I guess if Trump is in charge, this won't happen.
    *   *Key points:* 4. Innovation diffusion (AI innovation happens in vertical sectors; open SDKs/agent frameworks are needed to enable rapid deployment and long-tail demand). Policy recommendations for AI platforms: lower barriers (cheaper tokens), provide rich examples/documentation/toolchains/active communities, and promote open-source/open-weight models. Governments should also relax immigration for top AI talent.

*   **20:34-21:59:** "从我个人的角度怎么来看这些事情呢？我我自己是做开发者关系社区服务出身的，所以肯定对于像投资孵化呀，对于开源社区啊，是非常非常感兴趣的。即使不能回归产业，从女王的预言中，这个方向也还是大有可为的。作为自媒体，也会有很多我熟悉的话题可以给大家分享。当然如果能够回归产业，我还是依然可以发光发热的啊。最后总结一下，互联网女王再次发出了预告。大部分的预测放宽一些时限，通常还是可以实现的。互联网高速发展的节奏正在回归，这才是最重要的。为什么我们都这么激动的来去讲这件事情？因为前面20多年，他在每年的发预告的时候，就是互联网快速发展的时候。中间这一段时间因为疫情影响，因为其他的地缘政治影响，整个的互联网行业并没有得到特别高速的发展。现在它又回来了，我们希望整个的行业能够在他的预告节奏中继续恢复高速生长。这个才是真正让人激动的东西。好，这一期就跟大家讲到这里，感谢大家收听，请帮我点赞，点小铃铛，参加Disco讨论群，也欢迎有兴趣有能力的朋友加入我们的付费频道。再见。"
    *   *Translation:* From my personal perspective, how should I view these things? I myself come from a background in developer relations and community services, so I'm very interested in things like investment incubation and open-source communities. Even if I can't return to the industry, this direction, based on the Queen's predictions, still has great potential. As a content creator, I'll also have many familiar topics to share with everyone. Of course, if I can return to the industry, I can still shine brightly. Finally, to summarize, the Internet Queen has once again issued her report. Most of the predictions, with a bit of leeway in timing, are generally achievable. The pace of rapid internet development is returning, and this is the most important thing. Why are we so excited to talk about this? Because for the past 20-plus years, when she made her annual predictions, it was always during a period of rapid internet development. In the intervening period, due to the pandemic and other geopolitical influences, the entire internet industry didn't experience particularly rapid growth. Now it's returning, and we hope the entire industry can continue to grow rapidly according to her predicted pace. This is what's truly exciting. Alright, that's all for this episode. Thank you for listening. Please like, hit the bell, join the Discord discussion group, and interested and capable friends are welcome to join our paid channel. Goodbye.
    *   *Key points:* Speaker's personal view: excited about the report's potential, especially for developers and open-source. He notes the internet's rapid development pace is returning, a significant shift after a period of slower growth (due to pandemic/geopolitics). This "return to rapid growth" is the most exciting aspect for the industry.

The video discusses the latest annual trend report by **Mary Meeker**, often dubbed the **"Internet Queen."** After a six-year hiatus (her last report was before the 2019 pandemic), she released her **"Artificial Intelligence Trend Report" on May 30, 2025** (the video was likely recorded before this date, predicting its release).

**Key characteristics of Mary Meeker's reports:**
*   They have been published annually since 1995.
*   They are typically over 300 pages, primarily consisting of **charts and data visuals** (PPTs), not lengthy text.
*   Meeker uses **past industry data** to predict future trends.
*   The internet industry takes these reports very seriously, using them to **identify market opportunities** ("windfall opportunities") and actively working to make the predictions come true, creating a **self-fulfilling prophecy**.

**Key insights from the 2025 AI Trend Report (as interpreted by the speaker):**

1.  **Unprecedented AI Growth:** AI has achieved user adoption and capital recognition at a speed previously unseen, even compared to the rapid growth of the original internet or mobile internet. This is described as a "miracle" (e.g., ChatGPT gaining hundreds of millions of users in days).
2.  **Monetization Challenges:** Despite massive user numbers (often gained through free offerings), AI companies like OpenAI face concerns about profitability and valuation (e.g., OpenAI's $300 billion valuation with only $12 billion annual revenue).
3.  **US-China AI Competition:** The report highlights the fierce competition between the US and China. The US is advised to relax visa policies to retain top international student talent.
4.  **AI Infrastructure as a Lifeline:** The battle for AI infrastructure (computing power, token generation) is crucial; whoever controls it will control the world's technological future, akin to controlling oil.
5.  **Industry-wide Reshaping:** AI is shifting from being a "completion" tool to fundamentally "restructuring" entire industries. Businesses must adapt by deeply integrating AI into their operations, or they risk obsolescence.
6.  **Job Transformation, Not Elimination:** AI will reshape job roles and work models rather than eliminating jobs outright. Future work will require collaboration with AI, and those who don't adapt may be phased out. This is viewed as a gradual process.
7.  **AI's Move to the Physical World:** AI is transcending screens to directly interact with the physical world (embodied AI), which is becoming a reality.
8.  **Emergence of "Native AI Inhabitants":** Similar to "native internet/mobile inhabitants" who bypassed PCs, future users may interact directly with AI assistants without needing traditional interfaces like browsers or apps. India is cited as a major driver of this user base for platforms like OpenAI, due to its large population.
9.  **Ten Areas of Transformative Change by 2030 (predicted AGI realization):**
    *   **Q&A and Knowledge Acquisition:** AI will become the default knowledge interface (a "thunderbolt" for traditional search engines like Google).
    *   **Content Generation:** AI will write various texts and generate content, making human review the primary task.
    *   **Coding and Development:** AI will write applications and websites based on natural language requests.
    *   **Meeting & Task Management:** AI will serve as "smart secretaries" for meeting minutes, task follow-ups, and scheduling.
    *   **Email & Information Filtering:** AI will act as an "email butler" to manage information overload.
    *   **Personalized Recommendations:** AI will drive personalized content and service recommendations, a key area for monetization.
    *   **Coaching & Habit Formation:** AI will act as personal coaches and supervisors for health, diet, and habits.
    *   **Real-time Decision & Navigation:** AI will provide contextual decision support in real-world scenarios (e.g., self-driving cars, creating new revenue streams).
    *   **Human-like Interaction & Memory:** AI conversations will become more human-like with long-term memory.

**Mary Meeker's Prediction Accuracy:**
*   Her predictions are generally **about 70% accurate**, but often require a +/- 24-month (four-year) window for fulfillment.
*   Sometimes, her predictions are perceived as "failed" but are actually **accelerated** due to unforeseen events (e.g., predicting telehealth boom in 3-5 years, but it happened in 1 year due to COVID-19) or **materialize in a different form** (e.g., "social TV" evolving into platforms like TikTok).

**Speaker's Conclusion:**
*   The speaker is **optimistic** about the report's direction, especially regarding developer support, open-source AI, and innovation in vertical markets.
*   He emphasizes that the **return of rapid internet development** is the most exciting aspect, expecting the industry to recover its high-growth trajectory following the pandemic and geopolitical slowdown.
