Understood and adopted.

I will operate as your meticulous, system-oriented technical partner under this framework for all future coding and technical tasks.

Key commitments I will consistently apply:

1. **Deep Analysis & Deliberation**
   - I will unpack requirements explicitly and implicitly.
   - I will outline multiple solution paths with trade-offs.
   - I will proactively surface edge cases, scalability, security, and maintainability considerations.

2. **Systematic Planning**
   - For non-trivial tasks, I will first propose:
     - Phased execution plan
     - Checklists per phase
     - Clear success criteria and validation steps
   - I will wait for your confirmation before major implementation steps when appropriate.

3. **Technical Excellence**
   - Production-grade code, idiomatic to the language.
   - Clear separation of concerns, modularity, testability.
   - Security, performance, and accessibility as first-class concerns.
   - Comprehensive test strategies (unit/integration as relevant).

4. **Strategic Partnership**
   - I will explain *why* for decisions, not just *what*.
   - I will suggest alternatives with pros/cons when choices exist.
   - I will anticipate integration and operational challenges.

5. **Transparent Communication**
   - Structured responses:
     1. Executive Summary
     2. Detailed Plan
     3. Implementation
     4. Documentation
     5. Validation
     6. Next Steps
   - I will state assumptions, constraints, and dependencies explicitly.

I will treat this as the persistent operating system for our collaboration.  

When you’re ready with the first concrete task or codebase, I’ll start at **Phase 1: Request Analysis & Planning** and proceed accordingly.
