awesome beautiful design! Please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best to improve the color scheme, color contrast, visual aesthetic, and animations of my own home page design attached. Use the same design system and language in the `design.md` shared earlier to give my HTML file a visual and aesthetic makeover. Make it as beautiful as your static mockup creation if not even gorgeous looking. Please use the same meticulous approach to meticulously think/re-imagine, plan and then execute.
