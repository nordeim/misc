awesome job in your meticulous analysis, planning and execution! please keep up the rigorous and meticulous approach going forward! now, please think deeper and think harder to deeply explore thoroughly and systematically how best you will re-imagine a static HTML mockup for the "demo dashboard" with relevant sections to showcase the design components from the `design.json` file shared. Re-imagine the static HTML mockup made up of 3 files: `index.html`, `js/landing.js` (consolidate the Javascripts into one file) and `styles/globals.css` (consolidate the css components into one file). Splitting the static HTML mockup into 3 component files is to make it modular and easier for future customization. Please think hard and meticulously plan how the static HTML mockup should be like in order to proudly showcase your UI/UX taste and expertise. Please give me an wonderful surprise on how beautiful and elegant your visual design for the "Demo Dashboard" built using the elements from the `design.json`.

Then meticulously create an implementation plan to create the component files for the static HTML mock "Demo Dashboard". Review and validate your implementation plan before proceeding meticulously to execute it.
