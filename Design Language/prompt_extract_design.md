Deeply analyse the design of the attached screenshot to create a design.json file in this project that describes the style and design of every UI component needed in a design system at a high level like a creative director. Capture high level guidelines for structure, spacing, fonts, colours, design style and design principles so I can use this file as the design guidelines for my app. The goal with this file is to instruct Al to be able to replicate this look easily in this project.

Please deeply and meticulously analyse, examine and scrutinize carefully the attached image and extract/capture from it all its design language, design style, design essence, design nuances, design elements. Create a comprehensive and cohesive complete mental model of the design principles, style, language, etc. Then meticulously plan to translate your deep understanding into a `design.json` file that will encapsulate accurately and completely describes all the design details of the image and your understanding of it. You have to do record down details like the style and design of every UI component needed in a design system at a high level like how a creative director would spell out his design specifications. Capture high level guidelines for structure, spacing, fonts, colours, design style and design principles so I can use this json file as the design guidelines for my app. The goal with this file is to instruct Al to be able to replicate this look easily in another project. Review and validate your meticulous implementation plan to generate the `design.json` file within ```json tags. Then proceed meticulously to the `design.json` file.

Let's create a simple screen that contains every UI component that would exist in a design system on a mock dashboard, following the design style outlined in [1] design.json. Build this as a Vite app using react and translate all styling into tailwind v3. Then run this locally.

In this project create a folder named 'design' and create a design-system.json file in this folder that outlines the exact styling for all components and styles in this app along with high level design guidelines. The goal with the file is to create a comprehensive guide for AI to follow when builing new features in this app.
