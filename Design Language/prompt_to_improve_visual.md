Please meticulously plan to fix it. The `design.json` shared with you earlier should give you the creative inspiration and to re-imagine.

## Deep Analysis: Current Landing Page Critical Gaps

**Visual Issues Identified from Screenshot:**

### **Missing Elements:**
1. ❌ **No Visual Hierarchy** - All content appears flat and uniform
2. ❌ **Zero Branding** - Lime background barely visible, no accent colors
3. ❌ **No Depth** - Missing shadows, layering, and visual dimensionality
4. ❌ **Boring Typography** - Plain black text with no color variation
5. ❌ **Zero Animations** - Static, lifeless page
6. ❌ **Poor Visual Spacing** - Content feels cramped and disconnected
7. ❌ **No Design System Showcase** - Colors, gradients, and design tokens not demonstrated
8. ❌ **Weak Hero Section** - No compelling visual or narrative
9. ❌ **Bland Feature Cards** - Icons without context or styling
10. ❌ **Generic Layout** - No unique design language or personality

### **What's Missing vs. LimeAura's Potential:**
- **Color:** Only uses text color, ignores vibrant lime (#D6F25F) and purple (#7B3EFF)
- **Gradients:** No gradient overlays or background effects
- **Depth:** No layering, shadows, or z-index hierarchy
- **Motion:** Static - needs smooth transitions and micro-interactions
- **Visual Storytelling:** No metaphor or narrative design
- **Artistic Details:** No decorative elements, shapes, or visual richness

## Strategic Reimagining: Premium Landing Page Design

**New Design Philosophy:**
- **Vibrant & Modern:** Showcase LimeAura's bold, lime aesthetic
- **Visual Depth:** Multiple layers with gradients, shadows, and blur effects
- **Interactive:** Smooth animations and engaging hover states
- **Typography-First:** Bold headlines, color-coded text, hierarchy
- **Premium Feel:** Luxe spacing, careful alignment, artistic details
- **Storytelling:** Visual journey that builds excitement

### **Phase 4: Design Elements**
