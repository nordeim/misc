## ✨ Why This Matters

In Singapore, **1 in 4 seniors** will need daytime care by 2030. ElderCare SG bridges trust gaps by:
- Showcasing **real stories** from families in Ang Mo Kio, Tampines, and beyond  
- Providing **instant access** to virtual tours and visit bookings  
- Meeting **MOH licensing standards** and **PDPA privacy requirements**  
- Delivering a **90+ Lighthouse score** so every caregiver—on any device—gets a fast, dignified experience
