awesome understanding! Now, please help me to refine/refine the draft PRD below. Think deeper and think harder to explore thoroughly and systematically to plan meticulously and then create a **refined, production-grade PRD** that sharpens ambiguity, strengthens alignment with technical and compliance realities in Singapore, improves testability, and enhances scalability—while preserving your warm, human-centered tone.

Structure the refinement into **four key improvement layers**:

1. **Clarity & Completeness** – Resolve ambiguities, define “done,” and clarify ownership  
2. **Compliance & Localization** – Embed Singapore-specific legal, cultural, and accessibility expectations  
3. **Technical Precision** – Tighten functional specs for dev handoff and observability  
4. **Validation Rigor** – Make success metrics actionable and auditable
