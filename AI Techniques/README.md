## Analysis Summary

Purpose: Produce a publication-ready, blog-post version of a deep-dive guide summarizing and teaching the techniques presented in the YouTube video **“Stop Using AI Wrong – 30 Techniques You're Missing”** (source provided by the user).
Audience: Practitioners and knowledge workers who use LLMs and multimodal AI tools (product managers, content creators, growth marketers, designers, developers) who want concrete, repeatable techniques to get better results from AI.
Recommended Edit Mode: **transformational — justification:** the user provided a thorough draft that functions as a research/notes document; the task requires restructuring, polishing to publication-grade prose, clearer headings, added metadata, and fact-safety flags where video-specific claims require verification.
Top 3 Priorities:

* 1. Produce a clear, scannable, actionable guide that readers can apply immediately (how-to focus).
* 2. Preserve the original 30-technique structure while improving organization, examples, and flow.
* 3. Flag any statements that require verification against the original video (timestamps, direct quotes, claims about features/versions).
     Key Risks / Red Flags:
* [FACT-CHECK REQUIRED: Specific claims about product features, names, or dates referenced in the video — verify against the video transcript/timestamps before final publication.]
* [NEEDS_SOURCE] where the draft references product-specific strengths (e.g., “Claude better for tone/long form”) without citation.
  Suggested Success Criteria:
* Readability ≤ Grade 12
* Passive voice < 12%
* Clear call-to-action + three homework items for readers

## Polished Draft (blog-ready)

# Stop Using AI Wrong — 30 Practical Techniques You’re Probably Missing

*A concise, hands-on guide to using modern LLMs and multimodal tools effectively (actionable workflows, prompt patterns, and productivity features you can adopt this week).*

**Meta:** Practical, example-driven guide to 30 proven ways to get better outputs from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini and modern image generators. Suitable for creators, product people, and teams.
**Meta description (≤155 chars):** 30 actionable techniques to stop getting mediocre AI results — stepwise prompts, multi-model workflows, image refinement loops, and productivity features to adopt today.

---

## Why you’re getting mediocre AI results (short)

Most poor outcomes come from two root causes: (1) **vague prompts** and (2) **one-shot thinking.** Modern AI tools are most powerful when you treat them like collaborators — give role, context, constraints, and iterate. The short checklist: define the role → break the job into steps → provide examples → critique and refine.

---

## How to use this guide

Treat the 30 techniques as a toolkit. Try 3 this week (suggestion: #1 Break tasks into steps, #4 Self-critique, #19 Multi-model approach). Each technique includes a short explanation and a concrete example you can use immediately.

---

## Core principles (the compact rules)

* **Decompose:** smaller, sequential prompts beat giant catch-alls.
* **Context matters:** specify role, audience, constraints, and format.
* **Iterate & critique:** request revision, ask the model to self-critique, and repeat.
* **Save templates:** turn winning prompts into reusable templates.
* **Match tool to task:** use the model or modality best suited for the job.

---

## The 30 techniques (organized & actionable)

> Note: many of these are complementary — combine them into multi-step workflows.

### Prompting & Interaction (1–5)

1. **Break Tasks Into Steps**

   * *Why:* Smaller steps reduce ambiguity.
   * *How:* Sequence prompts: (A) research, (B) outline, (C) draft, (D) edit.
   * *Mini-prompt:* “Step 1: list 5 high-impact channels for an enterprise SaaS with $15k/mo ad budget.”

2. **Use Roles and Personas**

   * *Why:* Role context steers tone and priorities.
   * *How:* “You are a senior product manager at X with Y goals and Z constraints.”

3. **Chain Prompting (Pipelines)**

   * *Why:* Each stage transforms the artifact into a new deliverable.
   * *Example pipeline:* Research → 200-word summary → tweet → 800-word article.

4. **Self-Critique Loop**

   * *Why:* For quality, ask the model to critique its output and improve it.
   * *How:* “Identify 3 weaknesses in this draft and rewrite to fix them.”

5. **Reset Context When Switching Topics**

   * *Why:* Older context can leak into new tasks.
   * *How:* “Forget previous conversation. New task:” (or create a fresh chat/project).

### Output Guidance & Customization (6–8)

6. **Use Examples to Guide Output**

   * *Why:* Showing a reference produces closer stylistic matches.
   * *How:* Provide a short sample and request “rewrite in this voice.”

7. **Leverage Persistent Custom Instructions**

   * *Why:* Saves time; ensures consistent formatting and tone across sessions.
   * *How:* Set a default “You are…” + formatting rules in the model’s settings.

8. **Organize Projects/Uploads**

   * *Why:* Centralized project context improves coherence.
   * *How:* Upload guidelines, briefs, and files to a single conversation/project.

### Image generation & design workflows (9–13)

9. **LLM → Image Prompt Workflow**

   * *Why:* LLMs can craft high-quality image prompts (better specificity).
   * *How:* Ask the LLM to produce multiple variations of a prompt and test the top 2.

10. **Iterative Visual Refinement**

    * *Why:* Visual design often emerges across iterative edits.
    * *How:* “Make the image warmer; increase contrast; reduce background clutter.”

11. **Use an Image-First Iteration Tool**

    * *Why:* Some tools enable conversational editing (fast A/Bs).
    * *How:* Choose an image generator that supports conversational edit prompts.

12. **Maintain an Image Library**

    * *Why:* Reuse successful outputs and iterate from a known good baseline.

13. **Refinement Loop (Generate → Critique → Revise)**

    * *Why:* Systematic improvement with objective checks (composition, color, readability).

### Writing, ideation & learning (14–17)

14. **Tone Editor Trick**

    * *Why:* Use a model optimized for style to humanize copy.
    * *How:* “Rewrite the draft to be friendlier, 8th-grade reading level.”

15. **Brainstorm → Rank → Execute**

    * *Why:* Prevents idea paralysis; prioritizes action.
    * *How:* Generate 20 ideas, score by impact/effort, pick top 3.

16. **Learning Accelerator (Feynman-style)**

    * *Why:* Request progressive explanations to build intuition.
    * *How:* “Explain like I’m 10, then explain with equations.”

17. **Code + Explain**

    * *Why:* Always ask for line-by-line explanations when requesting code.

### Multimodel & prompt engineering (18–19)

18. **Multi-Model Approach**

    * *Why:* Different models have complementary strengths; combine them.
    * *How:* Use one model for ideation, another for tone polishing, then reconcile outputs.

19. **Save Prompt Templates**

    * *Why:* Reuse and refine effective prompts; treat them like code.

### Power features & productivity (20–24)

20. **Voice Mode**

    * *Why:* For fast brainstorming or interviews, speaking is faster than typing.

21. **Canvas / Collaborative Editing**

    * *Why:* Real-time multi-user editing speeds revision cycles.

22. **Web Search Integration**

    * *Why:* Ensures factual accuracy and up-to-date references for data-driven tasks.
    * *CAUTION:* Always verify sources and include citations when publishing.

23. **Drive / Cloud Connectors**

    * *Why:* Automatically ingest meeting notes, specs, and documents for richer context.

24. **Local Record & Transcribe**

    * *Why:* Use device-based recording/transcription to capture ideas and convert them into prompts.

### Deep thinking & evaluation (25–30)

25. **Extended Thinking / Longer Context Windows**

    * *Why:* Use models or modes that support long-form reasoning for complex work.

26. **Prompt Templates for Evaluation**

    * *Why:* Standardize model evaluation — clarity, accuracy, bias, helpfulness.

27. **Bias & Safety Checks**

    * *Why:* Add a stage to surface harmful, biased, or legally sensitive content.

28. **A/B & Human-in-the-loop Testing**

    * *Why:* Treat model outputs like product features — measure and iterate.

29. **Versioning & Archiving**

    * *Why:* Keep records of prompts and outputs to reproduce or roll back.

30. **Automation + Guardrails**

    * *Why:* Use agents/automations for repetitive tasks, but include human review checkpoints.

---

## Common mistakes & quick fixes

* **Vague prompt →** Add role, constraints, output format.
* **One-shot acceptance →** Add critique + rewrite loop.
* **Wrong tool →** Map tasks to model strengths (ideation vs. longform vs. logic). [NEEDS_SOURCE: compare model benchmarks before claiming superiority].
* **Ignoring model settings →** Experiment with temperature, length, and system prompts.

## Practical mini workflows (copy-and-use)

**A. Article workflow (5 steps)**

1. Research prompt → 2. Create outline → 3. Draft → 4. Self-critique & revise → 5. Tone polish + SEO pass

**B. Product spec workflow**

1. Upload user research → 2. Summarize pain points → 3. Prioritize features → 4. Draft spec → 5. Ask for unit test examples/code snippets

**C. Image design workflow**

---

## 4-week practice plan (put it to work)

* Week 1: Try three techniques (1, 4, 19) on a real task.
* Week 2: Build a prompt template library and save top 10 prompts.
* Week 3: Run A/B tests on outputs for quality/performance.
* Week 4: Automate 1 repeatable task with guardrails.

---

## What’s next in 2025+ (brief)

* Tighter agent orchestration, longer context windows, richer multimodal chains, and increased transparency in model reasoning. Expect workflows to shift from “prompt engineer” to “orchestrator + verifier.”

---

## Actionable summary & homework

1. Pick three techniques and use them this week.
2. Save and version your prompts and outputs.
3. Run a short A/B test comparing one human-only artifact vs. human+AI (measure time saved, quality delta).
