Based on the `select * from user;` output you provided after setting the password:

**Mostly Yes, but with important details:**

1.  **Defined Root Users:** You have `root` user entries for the following hosts:
    * `localhost` (Now has a password: `*8A24B641D1943F19759959F8FC49251B002F91B0` - the hash of 'Admin1234')
    * `desktop-va36t01` (Likely the hostname of your machine - **still has no password**)
    * `127.0.0.1` (IPv4 loopback address - **still has no password**)
    * `::1` (IPv6 loopback address - **still has no password**)

2.  **No Remote Host Entry:** There is **no entry** like `'root'@'%'` (which means "root from any host") or `'root'@'some_other_ip_address'`.

**Therefore:**

* As things stand *in the user table*, the `root` user is only defined for connections originating *from the local machine itself* (identified as `localhost`, the specific hostname `desktop-va36t01`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`).
* There is no user account configured that would allow a connection *as root* from a different machine on the network.

**However, there are crucial points to consider:**

1.  **Passwordless Local Root Accounts:** You only set the password for `'root'@'localhost'`. The other local `root` accounts (`desktop-va36t01`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) **still do not require a password**. This is a security risk *on the local machine*. You should either set passwords for these as well or, more commonly, remove the unnecessary ones if `'root'@'localhost'` is sufficient for your local administration needs.
    * To remove them (recommended if you only use `localhost`):
        ```sql
        DROP USER 'root'@'desktop-va36t01';
        DROP USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1';
        DROP USER 'root'@'::1';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        ```
    * Or to set passwords for them:
        ```sql
        ALTER USER 'root'@'desktop-va36t01' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewStrongPassword';
        ALTER USER 'root'@'127.0.0.1' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewStrongPassword';
        ALTER USER 'root'@'::1' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewStrongPassword';
        FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
        ```

2.  **Server Binding (`bind-address`):** The user accounts only control *who* can log in from *where*. Whether the server *listens* for network connections at all depends on the `bind-address` setting in your MariaDB configuration file (`my.ini` or `my.cnf`).
    * If `bind-address = 127.0.0.1` (a common default), the server only listens for connections from the local machine, effectively preventing *any* remote connections, regardless of user accounts.
    * If `bind-address = 0.0.0.0` or `::` or your machine's actual network IP, the server listens for remote connections. In this case, your current user table would still prevent *remote root login*.

3.  **Firewall:** A firewall (like Windows Firewall) could also be blocking incoming connections to the MariaDB port (default 3306) from other machines.

**In Conclusion:** Yes, based strictly on the user accounts shown, `root` login is restricted to the local machine. However, you still have passwordless `root` accounts accessible locally, and overall remote accessibility also depends heavily on the `bind-address` setting and firewall rules.

Okay, since you are already logged into the MariaDB monitor as the `root` user (as shown by the `MariaDB [mysql]>` prompt), you can set the password directly using the `ALTER USER` command.

Here are the steps:

1.  **Make sure you are at the MariaDB prompt:** It should look like `MariaDB [mysql]>` or `MariaDB [(none)]>`.
2.  **Execute the `ALTER USER` command:** Type the following command, replacing `'YourNewStrongPassword'` with the actual strong password you want to set. Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols for a strong password.

    ```sql
    ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewStrongPassword';
    ```
    * `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost'`: Specifies you are modifying the user `root` that connects from `localhost`. This is the most common account for local administration.
    * `IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewStrongPassword'`: Sets the new password. **Remember to replace the placeholder with your actual password!**

3.  **Reload Privileges:** Although often not strictly required for `ALTER USER`, it's good practice to ensure the changes are applied everywhere immediately:

    ```sql
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

4.  **Exit the MariaDB monitor:**

    ```sql
    EXIT;
    ```

**Example (using "P@sswOrd123!" as the password - please choose your own!):**

```sql
MariaDB [mysql]> ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@sswOrd123!';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.002 sec)

MariaDB [mysql]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.001 sec)

MariaDB [mysql]> EXIT;
Bye
```

**To verify the password is set:**

1.  Go back to your command prompt (`H:\xampp\mariadb>`).
2.  Try logging in again, this time using the `-p` flag:

    ```bash
    bin\mysql -u root -p
    ```
3.  It will prompt you to `Enter password:`. Type the new password you just set (e.g., `P@sswOrd123!`) and press Enter. Note that the password will not be displayed as you type.

If you can log in successfully, you have successfully set the password for the `root` user.

Yes, based on your successful login without a password and the output of `select * from user;`, you can correctly say that **for this specific, newly initialized MariaDB instance created by `mariadb-install-db.exe`**, the `root` user account(s) for local connections (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) **do not require a password**.

Here's why:

1.  **`mariadb-install-db` Behavior:** The `mariadb-install-db.exe` script (or its predecessor `mysql_install_db`) is designed to create the basic database structure and initial user accounts. By default, for security setup purposes, it creates the `root` user(s) allowing connections from the local machine *without* an initial password. This allows an administrator to log in immediately after installation to perform initial configuration, like setting the root password.
2.  **Your Evidence:**
    * You logged in using `bin\mysql -u root` and were not prompted for a password.
    * The output of `select * from user;` shows that for the rows where `User` is `root` and `Host` is `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`, the `Password` and `authentication_string` columns are empty. This confirms that no password hash is stored for these accounts.

**Important Security Note:**

While this is the *default* state after running `mariadb-install-db`, it is **highly insecure** for any system that will be used for real work or is accessible on a network. Leaving the `root` account without a password is a major security risk.

**Therefore, even though it currently requires no password, you should set a strong password for the `root`@`localhost` user immediately, as advised previously.**

Okay, based on the steps you've taken, you have successfully:

1.  Deleted the old MariaDB data directory contents.
2.  Re-initialized the MariaDB data directory using `mariadb-install-db.exe`. This process creates the essential system tables and typically sets up a `root` user **without a password** by default for initial access.
3.  Started the MariaDB service.

Now, to connect as the `root` user:

1.  **Stay in the current directory:** You are already in `H:\xampp\mariadb`.
2.  **Run the MySQL/MariaDB client:** Use the following command:

    ```bash
    bin\mysql -u root
    ```

    * `bin\mysql`: This tells the command prompt to execute the `mysql.exe` client located in the `bin` subdirectory. (Sometimes XAMPP might use `mariadb.exe` instead, if `mysql` doesn't work, try `bin\mariadb -u root`).
    * `-u root`: This specifies that you want to connect as the user named `root`.

3.  **Press Enter:** Since the `mariadb-install-db` script usually creates the initial `root` user without a password, you should be logged in directly to the MariaDB monitor prompt (it will look something like `MariaDB [(none)]>`).

**If the above command asks for a password:**

* Try running it with the `-p` flag, but press Enter immediately when prompted for the password:
    ```bash
    bin\mysql -u root -p
    ```
    Then, when it says `Enter password:`, just press Enter.

**Very Important Next Step:**

Once you are successfully connected as `root`, your **immediate priority** should be to set a strong password for the root user. You can do this using the following SQL command at the `MariaDB [(none)]>` prompt:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'YourNewStrongPassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

Replace `'YourNewStrongPassword'` with a secure password. After setting the password, the next time you connect, you will *need* to use the `-p` flag and enter the password you just set:

```bash
bin\mysql -u root -p
```
