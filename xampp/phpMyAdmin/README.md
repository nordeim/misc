The error:

```
ERROR 1064 (42000) at line 2: You have an error in your SQL syntax; … near 'varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT ''' at line 2
```

occurs because the SQL statement using `CHANGE` is missing the new column name. In MySQL/MariaDB, the syntax for the `CHANGE` command requires you to restate the column name even if you’re not actually renaming it. The correct syntax is:

```
ALTER TABLE table_name
  CHANGE old_column_name new_column_name column_definition;
```

If you are not renaming the column, you must specify the same name for both the old and new names.

There are two ways to fix this:

1. **Using CHANGE with proper syntax:**  
   Update your SQL file to repeat the column name:
   ```sql
   USE phpmyadmin;
   ALTER TABLE `pma__column_info`
     CHANGE `input_transformation` `input_transformation` VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ALTER TABLE `pma__column_info`
     CHANGE `input_transformation_options` `input_transformation_options` VARCHAR(256) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

2. **Using MODIFY if no renaming is intended:**  
   Alternatively, if you are simply modifying the column definition without renaming it, you can use the `MODIFY` command:
   ```sql
   USE phpmyadmin;
   ALTER TABLE `pma__column_info`
     MODIFY COLUMN `input_transformation` VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ALTER TABLE `pma__column_info`
     MODIFY COLUMN `input_transformation_options` VARCHAR(256) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin NOT NULL DEFAULT '';
   ```

Either approach will correct the syntax error.  
  
As a next step, you might want to verify that your MariaDB version supports your desired character set and collation, and also back up your database before applying such schema changes. Testing the changes in a development environment can help avoid unintended impacts on your production data.
