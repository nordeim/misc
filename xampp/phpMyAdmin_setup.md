Okay, let's break down this error.

**The Core Problem: "Headers Already Sent"**

The critical error messages are:

* `session_start(): Session cannot be started after headers have already been sent`
* `Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at H:\xampp\phpMyAdmin\vendor\beberlei\assert\lib\Assert\functions.php:35)`

This means PHP tried to start a user session (which involves sending HTTP headers like cookies to your browser), but *something else* had already sent output (text, HTML, error messages) before `session_start()` was called. Once output has started, headers cannot be modified.

**What Caused the Output? Deprecation Warnings**

Looking at the lines *before* the main error, you see several `Deprecated:` warnings originating from the Twig and Assert libraries (which phpMyAdmin uses):

* `Deprecated: Twig\Parser::addImportedSymbol(): Implicitly marking parameter $name as nullable is deprecated...`
* `Deprecated: Twig\Node\PrintNode::__construct(): Implicitly marking parameter $tag as nullable is deprecated...`
* (and the one explicitly mentioned in the final error) output from `Assert\functions.php`

Your PHP version (8.4.0) is very new and strict. It's generating these "Deprecated" warnings because the code in phpMyAdmin's libraries (Twig, Assert) is using some older PHP features in a way that will be removed or changed in the future. **These warning messages themselves count as output.**

**How to Fix It**

You have a few options, the first one being the standard way to run phpMyAdmin with XAMPP:

**Method 1: Use XAMPP's Apache Server (Recommended)**

phpMyAdmin is designed to be run through a full web server like Apache, not typically directly with PHP's built-in development server (`php -S`). XAMPP provides Apache for this exact purpose.

1.  **Stop the PHP Development Server:** Go to the command prompt window where `php -S localhost:8000` is running and press `Ctrl + C` to stop it.
2.  **Start Apache:** Open the **XAMPP Control Panel**.
3.  Find the **Apache** module and click its **Start** button. Wait for it to turn green and show a port number (usually 80, 443).
4.  **Start MySQL/MariaDB:** Ensure the **MySQL** (or MariaDB) module is also **Started** in the XAMPP Control Panel.
5.  **Access phpMyAdmin via Apache:** Open your web browser and go to the standard XAMPP phpMyAdmin address:
    * `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/`

This setup uses the PHP configuration associated with Apache (which might have different error reporting settings) and is the intended way to use phpMyAdmin within XAMPP.

**Method 2: Adjust PHP Error Reporting (If you must use `php -S`)**

If you absolutely need to use `php -S`, you can tell PHP not to output `E_DEPRECATED` warnings.

1.  **Find your `php.ini`:** The `php -S` command uses the CLI (Command Line Interface) configuration. Find the correct `php.ini` file. You can often find its location by running:
    ```bash
    php --ini
    ```
    Look for the line "Loaded Configuration File:". It might be something like `H:\xampp\php\php.ini`.
2.  **Edit `php.ini`:** Open the identified `php.ini` file in a text editor.
3.  **Find `error_reporting`:** Search for the line starting with `error_reporting =`.
4.  **Modify it:** Change it to exclude deprecated notices. A common setting that shows most errors *except* deprecated and strict notices is:
    ```ini
    error_reporting = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT
    ```
    (If the line starts with a semicolon `;`, remove the semicolon to uncomment it).
5.  **Save `php.ini`**.
6.  **Restart the PHP Development Server:** Run `php -S localhost:8000` again from the `H:\xampp\phpMyAdmin` directory.
7.  **Try accessing `http://localhost:8000`** in your browser again.

**Why Method 1 is Better:**

Using XAMPP's Apache is more robust, uses configurations better suited for web applications like phpMyAdmin, and avoids potential issues inherent in the simpler built-in PHP server. The `headers already sent` error often indicates that the environment isn't quite right, which using Apache usually solves.
